Frustratingly with no road and no x-street to pass to 000 it was simple as saying Alpha, Bravo, Charlie where GPS and three words was spot on in guiding the ambulance close. ""if we can't find you we can't rescue you"", and day or night not all calls for assistance come with an observable street address or for that matter even on ""Land"", that's within a three metre square.

8,71196640-467b-4cc7-80c4-40463099e32a,Steve C,Great 'just in case' app. Truncation of 'what three words' in primary and map screen may be problematic (unless font size significantly reduced impacting vision impaired individuals). When tapping info box from map screen all text increases in size and often pushes last of the 'three words' out of view/access. Better highlighting of additional services accessible through the menu may also assist those who haven't explored app prior to their emergency/crisis.,4,2022-09-13,,1

Less than 2 days ago there was a father and daughter lost in deep snow near Thredbo. This opportunity, and many others in the past, must be seized upon and the media used to educate and reinforce the need for all persons to have this app on their phone and to know how to use it.  I have used app before, as a Police Radio Dispatcher.  5 teenage girls were lost in bushland in winter at night. Police had been searching for them for some time but the girls didn't know where they were and a triangulation from there phone only showed a rough area. The supervisor was about to call in a helicopter to assist in the search. I called back the young girl's phone and asked if she had the Emergency+ app on her phone. She didn't but she did have internet connection so I was able to talk her through the download. Within minutes  I had her location PINPOINTED through the lat/long coordinates. Using mapping we were able to walk the girls to a close by track whilst coordinating Police to walk in from the nearest road.

It appeared the dispatcher was not looking at the same map as we could see on the app. It would vastly improve communication if the application were able to upload the coordinates to the 000 dispatchers via an internet or SMS link.
