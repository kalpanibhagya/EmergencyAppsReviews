Tom Wilson,Gives wrong address so how do I know the rest is correct.,2,2022-10-25,
R Johnston,"Locates correctly but can give an address 800m / 8 streets away. ""Last updated"" text can also be odd: ie ""19 years ago"". Must have to let it take time to settle down. SGS10.",3,2022-10-24,2.34

Gary Brown,"Rendering assistance to a lone dehydrated aged sailor at water's edge reporting as a ""concern for welfare"". Frustratingly with no road and no x-street to pass to 000 it was simple as saying Alpha, Bravo, Charlie where GPS and three words was spot on in guiding the ambulance close. ""if we can't find you we can't rescue you"", and day or night not all calls for assistance come with an observable street address or for that matter even on ""Land"", that's within a three metre square. Well done W3W.",5,2022-09-25,2.34
Targs 35 (Targs),Great app. Sister put me onto it. Shame there is no way to update the home location as a gps location does work for when you are multi level residential building.,4,2022-09-23,2.34
Gary Pitts,"Dangerous app. It thinks I am at my old address, some 50km from where I actually am. GPS won't update. Waze picks up my location correctly so it isn't a GPS or phone issue. This app is dangerous, it could send emergency services to the wrong location. It would be safer not to have the app and use street signs or landmarks or GPS coordinates from your phone to report your location.",1,2022-09-16,2.34
Steve C,Great 'just in case' app. Truncation of 'what three words' in primary and map screen may be problematic (unless font size significantly reduced impacting vision impaired individuals). When tapping info box from map screen all text increases in size and often pushes last of the 'three words' out of view/access. Better highlighting of additional services accessible through the menu may also assist those who haven't explored app prior to their emergency/crisis.,4,2022-09-13,
Peter Kirby,This is truly a life saving app,5,2022-08-28,
Douglas Haigh,Saved my life twice now how do you recommend it LIFE SAVING,5,2022-08-24,2.34
Jennifer,"The app isn't working right since last update. Map and numbers are half covered up and can't read 3 words at all as its so small. Please bring back the older version, or explain how I can revert it back as it no longer works",2,2022-08-22,2.34

Steve Angus,"Crashes, unable to open",5,2022-08-10,2.34
Floopyboo Tafka,"Location is about 500m out. In a residential area, this would have emergency services turning up to the wrong house -in my case half a block away and the wrong side of the street!",3,2022-08-09,2.34
Ian Shaw,This is a must have. If your unsure of the address were the emergency is just touch the app. There it is. All you need to get help.,5,2022-08-03,2.26

Rae Dowd,Awesome app great to have on your phone,5,2022-05-24,2.26
Jenna Daniells,"Not displaying my location correctly, more than 3km out.",2,2022-05-22,2.26
T James,"Your app sometimes displays the ""what3words"" text wrong between the ""Home"" screen and the ""My Location"" screen. At times on the ""My Location"" screen, the 3rd word is missing letters at the end of the word. But on the ""Home"" screen all letters appear. Thus, different words can be displayed when at the same location on the 2 different screens. If this review is monitored and your require clarification I have screenshots to illustrate.",4,2022-05-20,2.26
Jason Shelley,Awesome... everyone should have this app as it may just save your life or the life of a loved one .,5,2022-05-15,2.26
Robert Vanderwalle,Thank you You,5,2022-05-03,
Grant Hutchesson,"Info blurb says (in the ""app permissions"" section) that you can disable access to permissions in settings. After downloading, the ONLY settings option is to change the font size of GPS coordinates... a blatant lie - not cool. Why should this app need access to the storage of my phone??",2,2022-04-15,2.26
Patrick Ernst,"The so is generally good. I'd give it 5 stars but... the app has no exit option. Once started this app runs continuously until a Force Stop is used in settings, applications. This app only needs to run on demand NOT continuously. Please fix this flaw. It affects battery.",4,2022-04-12,2.26
Elizabeth Martin,"Just installed the app. My street number is 20. The app says I am 22, and I am sitting in the middle of my house.",3,2022-04-11,2.26
Harold Tran,I havent use it yet. Is there anyway/any app that can work from satellite signal on the phone where has no reception? Just for emergency in remoted area,3,2022-04-10,2.26
Louise Collins,000 should be swappable with the national relay service. All together items should be swappable on the first page,3,2022-03-15,2.26

Julie Dafkovski,"Great app spot on for locations, it is really good to have",5,2022-02-27,2.26
John Hyland,"Great and simple app, but accessibility is poor. It would be vastly better for older folk (or the vision impaired) if the required information wasn't in tiny text that's hard to read. It wastes a lot of screen space that could be better used.",3,2022-02-27,2.26
claudia morey (Cc),Good to use easy to connect with people,4,2022-02-20,2.26
Karen Kuhn,Love this app as you can provide a precise location if required. One thing that could make this more useful would be the ability to put a widget on your lock screen to allow instant access if needed similar to the emergency call option on lock screens. I have a medical app that provides my medical history etc and the widget gives instant access to my information in an emergency without having to unlock my phone.,5,2022-02-15,2.26
C I Bennett,"This is an app everybody should have on their phone. For the average, untrained person, it can be extremely difficult to think rationally in an extreme emergency due to adrenaline coursing through your system that often leads to panic. Giving information such as your whereabouts if you are in an unfamiliar place can make things worse. This app can lessen that sense of panic by giving you everything you need at your fingertips and if you don't know where you are what3words is just brilliant.",5,2022-02-02,2.26
NZIYUMVIRA Sylvestre,Good,5,2022-01-29,
JAY ST,Incredible life savings tech,5,2022-01-21,2.26
Gaz Ang,"It has got my address wrong, it thinks I live at 157 which is actually the 2 duplex dwellings behind me, I live at 159. There is no way to change this?? My wife or I could be dead by the time the emergency services find us?",3,2021-12-20,2.26
GÃ©rard DECOTTIGNIES,Very comprehensive and very easy to use.,5,2021-12-16,2.26
Stephen Fletcher,"App doesn't show my position (as indicated in app preview). Location is selected ""On"". Any thoughts or suggestion from anyone. Cheers",2,2021-12-13,2.26
Mick Newman,This is a great app but it needs to have the ability to be used on a phone that is locked with a password so a child can ring for help,5,2021-11-25,2.26
Sholto Jones,Just call 000 actually tried to use this app during an emergency and it didn't work. I ended up calling 000,1,2021-11-11,
Mick I am,"The concept of this app is sound and useful, however it's very hard to read for those who have less than ideal eyesight. Surely this must be obvious? An emergency app. is for everyone, not just for those with perfect vision! Get with it!",3,2021-11-11,2.26
Alana Walsh,App is recommended by Australia Wide First Aid... gives your exact location when talking to required emergency,5,2021-10-30,2.26
David ',"Please change the map/location functionality so that one tap anywhere on the lower half of the screen immediately makes it full screen with large text. At the moment it requires two taps to do this which hardly anyone is going to know. Also add large text ""Tap here for location information"". Great app otherwise.",4,2021-10-28,2.26
Peter Sibilant,"Location map is utterly broken and therefore pointless, and dangerous to rely upon. Just use Google Maps and share your location with a friend via SMS if you're lost.",4,2021-10-26,2.26
J S (Jewlzzz),I can't copy my long-lat or what3words to a text message. Please allow/ encourage copy for this. Data takes less power and signal.,4,2021-10-25,2.26

Andrew W,Look good so far,5,2021-08-31,2.26
Sam Fiffer,This is a great app but is there some way of getting the 3 words other than using your gps location. I would like to add the three word for location to evacuation plans.,5,2021-08-30,2.26
McKenzie Therapy & Training,This app is like my former girlfriend's clit....goes off at the slightest touch ð³ð...accidentally sending alerts often,1,2021-08-17,2.26
Just Me Drop in,Good idea. Hope i never need to use it.,5,2021-08-10,2.26

Dave Rawlins,Not really sure how to rate this as I've never had to use it,4,2021-07-13,
Diana Gibson,"Sorry, not happy Jan. what3words is a confusing addition to what was a user-friendly app - since usurping my Emergency+, I have not had a correct street address reflected and I now live about a kilometer away at the entrance to the dog-walking park instead of at an address, with actual Unit #, that used to be reflected. The 3 words applicable to my life vary from front to back door and indeed upstairs to downstairs. Now not confident that the authorities would find me in an emergency.",1,2021-07-05,2.26
Kirsty S (Kirst),Everyone needs this! Used when I came across a vehicle that had hit a poll at night. Was alone in the dark in a rural area and I could tell emergency services where I was. Everyone needs this app,5,2021-07-03,2.26
WILLIAM,"Best App, all my Family has it.",5,2021-06-27,2.26
Denis Smithson,Great app get it ready for when you need it.,5,2021-06-24,2.26
Benjamin Quilliam,"Good start. You need to add a share button to copy the what3words location, or to automatically share with a person ( via messenger or WhatsApp for example) or even share directly to emergency services. As well, add a live tracking service so that when we are out by ourselves we can share realtime location with a friend. Also have it so it alerts the friend with a notification after X minutes of not moving. Let the tracked user set how many mins of standing still before alert is sent.",3,2021-06-18,2.26

Hardcastle,Cool,5,2021-06-01,2.26
Trevor Wuoti,I hope it works when needed..,4,2021-05-23,2.26
Stewart Wilson,"Not the smartest design for what is supposed to be an emergency app. For one, and probably most importantly it should 'force start' location services (GPS) rather then relying on user activation. A kid may not know how to do this, or become confused. What3words is a joke. Fine if you speak fluent English, but not everyone does. Why couldn't a system of 2 letters and one number have been implemented instead, such as A3E. Cleary readable and pronounceable by everyone.",2,2021-05-19,2.26
Fay Katthagen,Need to put correct address 7 Waterbrook Close Idalia,4,2021-05-16,2.26
peter greenham,Not accurate with location! At least a minimum of one street away!,2,2021-05-09,2.26
Dazza Morris,Awesome app emergency services helps pinpoint your location by three words marking system easy to repeat over the phone. Just wait upto 30 seconds for it to work the GPS. It gives location without cell connection.,5,2021-04-19,2.26
Simon Victory,"Integrating W3W isn't a crash hot idea. It's literally a proprietary system. Plus codes would have been smarter, conforms more with the Digital Service Standard (due to it being open source) and relies less on people being fluent in English. Not just me though, reading some of the other reviews complaining about the different words appearing suggesting better word combinations, but that's now something that the devs now have zero control over.",2,2021-04-08,2.26
TJ,So useful. Has all the information you need and couldn't make assisting in an emergency easier!,5,2021-04-08,2.26

Jim Doherty,Brilliant,5,2021-03-10,2.26
Dawn and Graeme Brady,Appears to be good. I haven't tested it in an actual emergency yet but it got my address right which is a good start.,5,2021-03-01,2.26
Nyree Maffei,"Upon opening the app for the first time it had me located across the street at my neighbours house but I closed and opened again and the location was correct so all good. My concern would be the words used, I watched a few times and some of the words I felt may be too hard to pronounce for some people, so maybe an update could keep words under maybe 5 letters. Otherwise, what a brilliant app :)",4,2021-03-01,2.26

Sylvia Fairhurst,"The concept is great, but location details are incorrect & a few years out of date. My address dosent exist on this app at all. Until the app is updated, it's useless for Emergency services &clients",1,2021-02-17,2.26

Tony Haigh,Helpful,5,2021-02-08,2.26
Irene D,"ALL FONTS NEED TO BE MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LARGER. I need glasses to read, but in an emergency may not have them or be able to reach them. The app doesn't allow ""pinching"" the screen to make the print larger. The screen desperately needs to be rearranged so that the info is MUCH MUCH LARGER",1,2021-02-06,2.26

Rick igloo,maybe one day we would be able to send a SMS emergency alert ??,5,2021-01-26,2.26
Ceci A,"Love the concept, haven't use this in emergency but i think the 3 word concept could be improved to be more inclusive for people with visual disability or non english speaking people...or if you are about to pass out. Say maybe press a button to send a location signal or it reads out the 3 words for the caller.",4,2021-01-20,2.26
Ingolf Schmacke,All and everybody's must have,5,2021-01-19,2.26
Nat L,"Unfortunately, the location is way off. It continues to pin point me on the other side of town which would be a huge problem if it were an actual emergency. The concept is good though, the app itself is very responsive and easy to understand.",3,2021-01-17,2.26
Cameron McKenzie,"Downloaded to consider as an option for an elderly relative in a remote location who may need to call ambulance. Unfortunately, text size defaults are difficult to see and not clear if it can be changed... highly recommend updating to improve usability for sight challenged users and other user groups who could struggle with the interface. We will print what3words co-ordinate for our relatives property and put in their wallet and on their fridge, but not ideal if they are moving around.",2,2021-01-16,2.26

Ken Oliver,"I assumed it would AUTOMATICALLY SMS location to the operator. This is trivially easy to program. Instead it asks you to verbally relay it, with huge opportunity for errors and delay. Useless.",1,2021-01-13,2.26

Cliff Bower,Fortunately I have not had to use this app. However it looks exactly what I would need should the occasion arise.,5,2021-01-09,2.26
Didi Jaeche,Without having actually used it in an emergency ...initially it located me next door but after going back and forth between location and home ( where I was) on the app it adjusted to the correct address. I particularly liked being able to put the location display on large writing. When I wear sunglasses I can only read large print. Also good to press just one button.,5,2021-01-05,2.26
Greg Conn,"Unfortunately this app puts me 7 houses away from my correct location, and there is no way to correct this ,that I can see. Not good enough for an emergency situation. Ill tell emergency my 3 words from that app myself.",2,2021-01-02,2.26
prepressguy from Australia,"It works well for me. Address is spot on each time I check. Thankfully I didn't need to use it for real emergency yet, but it's easy to use and could be very helpful. Thank you",5,2020-12-29,2.26
Jim Filmer,"Location on map appears correct, but address (street number) is incorrect - the inconsistency makes one wonder how this may impact on timely emergency services response in an emergency.",3,2020-12-23,2.26
Sean Austin-Eames,Thanks to the team at the National Triple Zero Awareness Work Group for updating the app. It is now working very well on my phone. Hope I don't have to use it.,5,2020-12-21,2.26
Kevin Nolan,Ever since this app was updated it is now giving incorrect addresses. It is telling me that I'm at 36 when I'm at 47. When I was in a different area it was telling me I was at number 5 when I was at 25 that is a big difference. Not very good if you do not know where you are and need help. You need to look into this and make it more accurate it's not only on this advice it was on two other advice .,3,2020-12-18,2.26

Also had thought the what the words was spam advertising until someone said you can say the words. Who knew about that. More education required.,1,2020-12-12,2.26

Judy Anne,Unable to access this new emergancy plus app. Samsung 7,1,2020-11-14,
Mikey Strikey,"Sad that an app can have so much negativity attached to it just for an upgrade fault. Now its fixed... those negative votes should be removed. Have not had an emergency yet, but the App works fine for me. Seems there was a genuine fault, but latest version as of 14/11/20 is working fine on my 2 year old MotoG7 phone. Simply tap the App.... and then tap the 000 button (or other if you wish) and you are ready to communicate with the operator. At the bottom of the screen was my exact position... wow. How good is that? I mean if you are lost, it is also helpul to see where you are. Should be compulsery for all phones in Oz. For a lousy $1.29 it is almost classed as free. Thanks to the providers of this app... feel safer already lol. Will be getting my partner connected also asap. BTW... only reason I get this is because saw it on TV this morning. Thanks channel 9 (smile).",5,2020-11-14,2.23

aussie43,"The latest revision of the app looks OK on a 6.7"" screen. On a 5.2"" screen the wording of the location and the co-ordinates are on top of each other. The 3 words are too small to see. Trying to touch or to move the text to see it clearly has no effect. The only helpful thing is to touch the map - but who knows that? On the following screen, the address, co-ordinates and the 3 words are visible as they should be. The location on the map is not shown, because it is not centered, and is out of bounds of the frame. The 3 word system is smart, however, as I hold the phone, the words are changing constantly. This could lead to misunderstanding with the operator. Australia is a developed and wealthy country. It should adopt a system where the location of the phone is sent out on a touch of a button. Can't imagine a person suffering stroke being able to operate this app and read out anything correctly.",3,2020-11-13,2.23

Rookie,"App still works on my Android, W3W is a great introduction. However, when increasing the text size, it reaches a point where it won't display in the screen properly, as there's no ability to scroll down - yet lots of wasted up the top. Biggest complaint of the update is the icon change - more modern yes, but isn't obvious at all like the original that it's an emergency app. Even the new icon being red would be a better start.

Gordon CAMPBELL,"Neil's comment (20th April 2020) is 100% correct. I have the app and give it 5 stars... but... a newer app does so MUCH MORE!!! Check out 'What3Words'. It has so many more uses and is used by millions of people since it was launched in 2013. ie; Locating friends in crowds at a football match or rock concert (not much use right now but will be when COV-19 is under control), quickly finding a business in large industrial complexes; finding a friend's camping spot off the beaten track. Sure, you can use GPS co-ordinates, but three words are so much easier to enter and remember than a string of numbers.Try it.",5,2020-05-30,1.26

A Google user,"Excellent service, app great resource.",5,2020-04-22,
A Google user,"Excellent - but needs one tweak. This app should be preloaded on every Aussie mobile device, for its ability to quickly provide an accurate location to emergency services. However, it would be much improved for rural and highway use by adding an approximate distance and bearing from the nearest town, as the lat/long may be too complex and the highway name and 'suburb' not specific enough for some users and/or agencies.",5,2020-04-20,1.26

No frills; it opens up quickly and silently every single time, and provides location data as soon as possible, including GPS coordinates and address.

Be aware that if your 'location' function is turnred off this app will not over ride and turn it on. This would be an important upgrade, as would-be making the app accessible without the need to login. Also, a button is used to call 000 in one touch. It's accompanied by several other buttons. Perhaps it would be faster if 3 buttons were available for 000. This should expedite the call.",3,2020-02-16,1.26

Less than 2 days ago there was a father and daughter lost in deep snow near Thredbo. This opportunity, and many others in the past, must be seized upon and the media used to educate and reinforce the need for all persons to have this app on their phone and to know how to use it.  I have used app before, as a Police Radio Dispatcher.  5 teenage girls were lost in bushland in winter at night. Police had been searching for them for some time but the girls didn't know where they were and a triangulation from there phone only showed a rough area. The supervisor was about to call in a helicopter to assist in the search. I called back the young girl's phone and asked if she had the Emergency+ app on her phone. She didn't but she did have internet connection so I was able to talk her through the download. Within minutes  I had her location PINPOINTED through the lat/long coordinates. Using mapping we were able to walk the girls to a close by track whilst coordinating Police to walk in from the nearest road.

A Google user,Great app. Would have come in very handy in a recent incident I experienced where I had to call emergency while in shock and I had lost my reading glasses in the incident. The only suggestion I'd make is for the address and GPS coordinates to be a bit bigger to make them easier to read without glasses for those of us who need them.,5,2017-10-04,1.16

The dispatcher reported their maps do not show the off-road walkways and cycle paths that are clearly available on the app, and googlemaps and openstreetmaps. Or did he transcribe the coordinates incorrectly ? It appeared the dispatcher was not looking at the same map as we could see on the app. It would vastly improve communication if the application were able to upload the coordinates to the 000 dispatchers via an internet or SMS link. It would also be a very useful extension if the application could share the coordinates via SMS or internet links to Council or National Park Rangers etc.,. who may need to unlock gates for ambulance and police to reach incident sites.",4,2016-01-16,1.11

Andy Tibicen,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.,5,2021-09-18,

Gregory Opera,"As a former emergency responder, I think âEmergency Plusâ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display oneâs exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is âcriticalâ information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even thereâ¦ For example, to find the âCPR guidesâ and âfire alertsâ, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking âMore Informationâ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either âRoyal Life Savingâ or âFire Alertsâ.

This is way too many steps to access âcriticalâ information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldnât even realise that they could find âcriticalâ information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see âApple Watchâ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use âEmergency Plusâ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to oneâs Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also donât understand why there is no support for âAmber Alertsâ whatsoever.

I rarely know when âAmber Alertsâ have been issued, because I donât listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I donât use social media, so the only time I know thereâs an âAmber Alertâ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)â¦ If this application supported âAmber Alertsâ or better yet, supported âAmber Alertsâ AND âApple Watchâ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an âAmber Alertâ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, âEmergency Plusâ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etcâ¦) to anybody in the affected areaâ¦ As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

âEmergency Plusâ is an invaluable application to install on oneâs smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (âdraftâ) applicationâ¦ Whilst Iâm sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2,2022-03-22,

Ava0Q,"Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times.",5,2017-02-08,
Maggiemg22,"I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea.

Leamik,It'd be good if it actually had my location correct instead of 20km away and not giving me the closest address I'm afraid that's not going to be much good the ambos if they can't find me or is it just accurate for NSW and not any other state ??? Definetly needs some updating done on it before I consider it useable,2,2014-04-06,

Need-a-list,"Recently speaking with a 000 operator friend about the App and the biggest issue they said is that the current 000 dispatch system apparently requires a street and nearest cross street for a dispatch. Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"".  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once. Or make it that the 000 operator can gain a street address from the displayed Lat/Long and work out a cross street themselves.",3,2016-12-24,

dindindins,"App is frequently advertised by emergency services, however it has not been updated for 2 years and references the now non-existent âhome buttonâ in the instructions. It also does not fit on the screen for an iPhone X and up (XR, XS, 11, etc).  

The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: â13-2500â is listed when it should be â132 500â. 

Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.

This app could be helpful, however in its current for it either needs to be updated or advertising by emergency services needs to cease.",2,2020-01-05,
