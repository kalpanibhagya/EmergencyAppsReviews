Another example is under diabetic emergency they are talking about low blood sugar and then cite the problem as a lack of insulin.  After being a diabetic for over 40 years, I can tell you low sugar is caused by too much insulin.   Only being a diabetic in itself is a lack of insulin, not the emergency they are talking about.

Love the clean and user-friendly appearance of the app. Nice to have the quizzes. I feel much more confident now...knew more than I thought.  Could a brief section about flood/storm safety info be added in a future update? Adding all the separate apps available on the Google play store seems excessive to me but that's from so  Also a training course for Mental Health emergency care seems like the next step in raising awareness and taking stigma away from mental illness. Could be helpful for educators, ER staff, friends/family, etc. As our society continues to grow in acknowledging the importance of mental health, we also need to know more about how to support others.

It says to apply ice or a cold pack. This may be fine for normal stings, but in the case of a severe allergic reaction/deadly venom this would decrease chances of survival because this will speed the spread of venom.  The ironic thing is that I learned this in an American Red Cross Course this year. Also in the section on recognizing symptoms of brown resluse/black widdow bites it describes black widdow twice and doesn't include brown recluse.  It would also be advantageous to have pictures of the snakes that it lists as venomous as their names mean little to most people.",4,2017-05-17,2.4

Neither is in any of the class materials (although the plastic is a good idea.) - General lack of basics such as checking the scene, getting consent, checking for conciousness, etc.  Most of the stuff on it is rock solid and consistent, and the few minor quibbles are not a big deal really.

,Chuck10011,"Everyone, who is not already an expert in first-aid, should have this app or a similar one on their phone.  It gives good advice for a variety of situations where you could help someone, even perhaps saving their life.

I don't understand the few reviews I've seen that say the app is dumbed down.  In some situations there's simply not much a non-expert with no equipment could do, except to call 911.  The fact that ""Call 911"" appears early and often in the list of steps is NOT a meaningful criticism of the app.  Even an expert should do that, as an ambulance and hospital are simply better equipped to help than even the most expert person who has no equipment with them.

There is only a small chance you will ever need to use this app, but if you do need it, you don't want to be waiting for it to download.  Get this app.

I do have one criticism of the app.  It can list nearby hospitals.  This would be a great feature, except its database includes even specialty hospitals with no ER.  Seems like a first-aid focused app should only be listing hospitals that have urgent care facilities, perhaps even separately indicating ""Emergency"" vs ""Urgent Care"" locations.  The closest hospital to me, for instance, is the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.  Fortunately, in that case the name is a give-away that urgent care will not be available there.  But what about similar specialty hospitals where it's not obvious from the name that urgent care will be unavailable?",5,2014-08-31,

I downloaded this app thinking it would cover things like proper field dressing of a wound in order to get someone to the help they need, but instead it only tells you to keep pressure on the wound, call 911 and wait for help to arrive. Completely useless of you are in an area or situation where help cannot be counted in to arrive on a timely manner such as hiking in the backcountry or in the middle of a natural disaster. Not to mention the bites and stings section doesn't even attempt to cover snake bites, only insect stings. And the anaphylaxis section gives you no help in managing the anaphylaxis until help is available, only "" if the person is suffering from anaphylaxis call 911"". God forbid anyone have an accident outside of cell coverage. Seriously all of these 5 star ratings must be the developers friends and family or people who have not even the slightest clue what first aid actually is, this app will not save anyone's life ever. It is very incomplete and like I said is basically just a 911 button.

,MaileSundquist,"So the idea of this app is great!  I love the layout and info., although some of the grammar could be better, but the tests do not work properly.  For instance, I answered all of the questions correctly for the bleeding test, however it only said that I had one correct answer.  The reason I know I was correct on the other questions, aside from being confident in this knowledge already, was that the test showed the answers for the ones you get wrong, and ""correct"" for what you get right.  In the written answer area, it stated all of the correct answers, which were the ones I gave, but it didn't give me the credit for them.  When I tried several more times it would only give me credit for one more answer, even though they all should have been correct from the start.  I tried the allergy test, another area that I am competent in, and it did the same thing, but this time for  2 of the 5.  It's a shame!  The tests are a fun idea, but don't work.

I've taken the all the tests on the app (and have gotten 100%), and for the broken bone test I selected the two correct answers for what to do to when someone comes up to you with a broken arm, which is to hold it and support it with a cushion. The app still marks it wrong even though I've put in those answers about 10 times.

,Sammyr123,"The Red Cross takes the same line that many corporations and all governments do. Namely, you're too stupid to understand all but the simplest information. You can't be trusted to handle anything requiring thought or imagination! So, just shut up and do what you're told and nobody will get hurt. 
Unfortunately, in many cases, people WILL get hurt without enough information then and there at the scene while waiting for the ambulance to arrive! So, instead of offering enough facts for you to try to help the injured person, they usually just give the skimpiest of information and tell you to have someone else (NOT YOU, remember, you're too stupid to be able to make a call while you sit there ""reassuring"" the person) call 911!!!

,Dhkbcddyhgdfhklplkllllpppp,"So, this is interesting. Now I live alone in my house with just me, my cats, and my dead hamster. I work as a self-employed construction worker, and I was just getting back from knocking down this wall when I heard the scream.

The hamster was caught underneath his pull up bar and was squirming. I rushed downstairs and started yelling: ""Tod are you okay?"". He spiritually answered me and I started screaming at the cats to get help. They ran and i moved in to help Tod.

With all my might, i pulled him out and brought him to the baby changing station i had installed in my kitchen. i took this grate class in medical scool so im rellly good at first ade. I kept pushing down on him while i was looking at this ap thing. It said to give CPR to the individual and push down as hard as possible and so i did and Tod was crushed to death when i brought a pickaxe from my job.

The more i think about it Tod was fine and i didnt need to do it. i keep him in a garbage bag and mourn his loss every day with his shrine in the kitchen. One of the cats never came back and the other four came back.

I think i should ""punish"" them. If they got help Tod would still be alive. stupid $^&^%$&**** cats.",4,2015-12-02,
,Angel N Danny,"This app is good if u have taken first aid classes, you can use it as a basic (VERY BASIC) reminders. It does not give step by step on what to do. Even in the test question: chocking: it gives a scenario and ask what's the next thing to.. The only option that is close to being right... Truly is about the 4th step. U don't see someone chocking and just walk up to them and hit them on the back. 1st you introduce yourself 2) you ask them are they chocking 3) u ask them if it is ok with them that u help them 4) then you would administer the proper procedure. It also does not show u how or where to place your arm before firmly hitting them on the back. App truly lacks a lot so please don't use this as your only tool for what to do in any emergency!

Also when I went to look at all my achievements- the app froze.",3,2013-07-09,
,DCSnowPatrol,"Great App.  I really like their other apps too like the hurricane app.  I rated a four for two reasons: 1) It isn't formatted for the iPad - minor I know but a little annoying having a lot of screen real-estate and not using it.  2) The first aid information is only online.   While in most circumstances that will be fine in the event of an disaster ie. a hurricane when power and network connectivity is unavailable the first aid information wouldn't be available.  

Otherwise spectacular app.  Red cross please format for IPad and make first aid info downloadable.  I'd even be willing to donate/pay for app with first aid content being downloaded to the device.",4,2012-10-30,

I felt secure in that. So, when I faced an emergency poisoning incident I was surprised, and disappointed, that this app didn‚Äôt come up to my expectations. In this case, the emergency didn‚Äôt require a 911 call nor a trip to the ER. All that I needed was a simple step by step guide to address the situation. This app didn‚Äôt deliver. I ended up having to find what I needed on the internet. Now, I was glad that at least there were instructions to call 911. And, there are ways to determine if that‚Äôs even needed. The information is general and basic; not at all what I expected. I could have saved time by going directly to my browser for answers.",2,2016-04-18,
,Tom Boz,"The emergency preparedness kit list is good, but since it is a list of very basic suggestions, I would add a propane camp stove, several small fuel canisters, matches, and at least one battery powered LED lantern. Being able to cook food is a huge stress reliever, especially in a cold climate.

One gallon of water per person per day does not allow washing anything, so also paper plates, cups, napkins, disposable cutlery, and trash bags. 

All of the above could be added for less than $150 (the stove and fuel would be about half the total) and would make a very meaningful difference in stress levels. Not everyone would spend the money or storage space, but those who do would be far better prepared. Reducing stress levels is critical. Hot food and a decent light help a lot.

I would also consider tranquilizers for pets if people need to evacuate- especially for house cats. And a small cage.",4,2012-11-06,

I would like to see ""Stings & Bites"" under the list of emergencies, as opposed to the ""ad type thing"" at the top of the page. As that is probably a common emergency. 
I would also like to see sunburns added. I got one of those today, and to my surprise, help for that wasn't in this app! 
Please add blisters too! :D
Something about ""Wild animal bites"" might also be helpful. I was bitten by a stray/ferrel cat a while ago, and didn't do anything about it, not knowing what to do. I did a school report on rabies a while afterwards, and it got me thinking, what if I get bit by another animal. :)

,Revmat,"I recently took a Red Cross class and I wanted to see if anything stuck. I went straight to the tests. Surprisingly enough I only missed one question (I had the person keep their burn under cool water for a few minutes too long).
It really shouldn't be used in an emergency, but is a good reminder of what to do if you find yourself needing to treat someone in an emergency.

You should always get certified by a professional and do the hands on training, but the certification could be 1-2 years, so it's good to take refreshers if you're not an EMT or RN.

Good basics and simple run down of what to do. I recommend this not for those who have no background, but for those who need the refresher. However, if you can't afford to take the classes or are cannot get to any in your area, this is the next best thing.

What do you do if, for whatever reason, emergency services are unavailable?

I really enjoy taking the tests both before and after going through the learning sections. The reward badges are very positive and motivating when achieved.

‚Ä¢ Wear a GPS locator!

Has various subjects for the non-first-aid person. Has an Emergency section that you can use in a hurry with a Call 911 button. 

Even has an achievement system, if you're into that. 

Only issue I've experienced is cross-referencing. E.g.: Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke (You have to go into one to see the other).

,r3boys,"1. This is not a completely reliable database for the official medical techniques and knowledge it advertises. Too afraid of imperfect and causing someone to get hurt over an ignorant rescue when that is going to cause a worse problem. They would rather you call 9-1-1 and wait for the police then tell you what you REALLY should do to a bleeding wound, snake bite, heart attack, etc... I should hope one wouldnt solely rely on this app for a camping trip or if they are hours away from a quality hostpittle. Don't download this without looking at it first. The info on treating a heart attack literally say this: 1. See if they have unexplained pain (and do not mention the left arm sign) 2. Call 911 3 give them aspirin 4. Reassure them. Really? 

2 unclean design, lack of content and videos. There is no section that portrays how to deal with no-serious injures, such as swelling or icing after a run. Few videos and photos are all blown up with low resolution. 

3.It should be fully functional without internet. I know this is an iphone app, but don't shut it off if I'm using an ipad and I'm away from wifi. 

All in all Im disappointed because i see HUGE value in it. If it was sleek enough to droll over, wise enough to tech you and not be worried that someone will use it ineffectively(some knowledge is better than none, add to the disclaimer), accessible, updating frenquetly, FULL OF DETAIL, and put forth the actual bank of knowledge that educators have stored, it would be well on its way yo educating children and adults alike, and maximizing its usefulness. Teenagers in particular think first aid is a very vool subject when presented correctly, with all the facts. Its like a martial arts discipline.This app could be legendary, so throw some funding in or get rid of it, the camper manual is out-doing it so far except the awesome tests. Don't ice it with any childish features. Make it excessively informative and professional sounding, as though you were reading a wikipedia page decorated with red and silver. (Wolfram aha connectivity)  This could be an outlet for people to relish in medical knowledge as a hobby, and it couldn't hurt to have more life guards in everyday life!",2,2014-07-23,

Having taken ARC first aid & CPR classes in the past, this app is a good refresher and very useful for those who haven't taken such classes and are trying to get ahead of the curve in an emergency.   

Like to see added:
In going through the app to see what first aid topics it covered, I noticed that it did not have anything for any of the heat-related emergency situations: heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat rash.  These are covered in the American Red Cross ""Heat Wave Safety Checklist"" (at RedCross.org > Preparing > Preparedness Fast Facts) so it is surprising it's not covered in the app.  Of course, it could be that the only reason I noticed its absence is because it was almost 100F today, one of many very hot days we've been having lately.  Hope to see heat-related illness added in an upcoming update.",4,2012-06-17,
