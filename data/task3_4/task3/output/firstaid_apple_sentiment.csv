0,Eyeless Fish,"I was just checking out the app, and it looks like a good chunk of it is accessible. But, in the quizzes there is one area where it is not.  It‚Äôs the quiz that talks about what to do if someone is bleeding. Three out of the four questions and answers are accessible.  But, number two is not. How do you expect a blind person to be able to be able to touch the spot where you put a tourniquet. Come on! You‚Äôre the American Red cross. You should be able to get this right.  If this gets fixed I will fix my reading.",4,2019-08-31,-1
1,Jooho Kim,"Thorough this app I could learn what I have to do in emergency situations. Every people have possibility of facing the emergency situation in their own life or someone else's while we are living. So when we know what we have to do in emergency situations we can save more lives. This app is the first step for make it possible. 
I installed this app several years ago. At that time there was no quiz section but these days it has. The quiz section is really helpful. Through quiz I could assessed not only my knowledge was right but also corrected wrong knowledges previously I had and got some new informations. 
I strongly recommend this excellent app for everyone.",5,2017-03-14,1
2,Gpa Gregg,"I have no confidence in this app when attempting to schedule or reschedule a platelet donation. Every time I attempt to, it requires a phone call to the Red Cross to correct the schedule. Why use it at all when the dates seem to get mixed up every time I attempt to schedule or postpone an appointment? I do like using the app to fill out the Rapid Pass, but I won‚Äôt be using the app to do any scheduling from now on. I also don‚Äôt like depending on the app to keep track of all my donations. I have a whole stack of plastic cards from my days of donating whole blood and platelets. I‚Äôve been a whole blood donor since 1986 and the Red Cross discontinuing the tracking of donations on the plastic cards saddens me.",2,2018-06-30,-1
3,tllado,"Great app, tons of info, well organized, but would be so much more useful if it had a widget. Something people could access immediately from the lock screen. If the app is buried on page four, people are going to waste valuable time searching for it.

4,abcancino93,"For the most part the app is good and informational. But two of the quizzes don‚Äôt seem to have the right answer amount set or inform you the proper answers.

6,Drummerkat,"I really like having this mobile first aid app. It's easy to read and access.  I wish the quizzes were longer and more thorough and I'd like the answers to be more challenging.

74,Chuck10011,"Everyone, who is not already an expert in first-aid, should have this app or a similar one on their phone.  It gives good advice for a variety of situations where you could help someone, even perhaps saving their life.

I don't understand the few reviews I've seen that say the app is dumbed down.  In some situations there's simply not much a non-expert with no equipment could do, except to call 911.  The fact that ""Call 911"" appears early and often in the list of steps is NOT a meaningful criticism of the app.  Even an expert should do that, as an ambulance and hospital are simply better equipped to help than even the most expert person who has no equipment with them.

There is only a small chance you will ever need to use this app, but if you do need it, you don't want to be waiting for it to download.  Get this app.

I do have one criticism of the app.  It can list nearby hospitals.  This would be a great feature, except its database includes even specialty hospitals with no ER.  Seems like a first-aid focused app should only be listing hospitals that have urgent care facilities, perhaps even separately indicating ""Emergency"" vs ""Urgent Care"" locations.  The closest hospital to me, for instance, is the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.  Fortunately, in that case the name is a give-away that urgent care will not be available there.  But what about similar specialty hospitals where it's not obvious from the name that urgent care will be unavailable?",5,2014-08-31,1

78,SGTMiles,"This app does not give step by step first aid instructions. It basically says for every thing don't panic and call 911. I don't need an app to tell me to call 911. I downloaded this app thinking it would cover things like proper field dressing of a wound in order to get someone to the help they need, but instead it only tells you to keep pressure on the wound, call 911 and wait for help to arrive. Completely useless of you are in an area or situation where help cannot be counted in to arrive on a timely manner such as hiking in the backcountry or in the middle of a natural disaster. Not to mention the bites and stings section doesn't even attempt to cover snake bites, only insect stings. And the anaphylaxis section gives you no help in managing the anaphylaxis until help is available, only "" if the person is suffering from anaphylaxis call 911"". God forbid anyone have an accident outside of cell coverage. Seriously all of these 5 star ratings must be the developers friends and family or people who have not even the slightest clue what first aid actually is, this app will not save anyone's life ever. It is very incomplete and like I said is basically just a 911 button. If you didn't know how to call 911 in the first place you probably shouldn't be outside of your house without an adult.",1,2012-09-03,-1
79,MaileSundquist,"So the idea of this app is great!  I love the layout and info., although some of the grammar could be better, but the tests do not work properly.  For instance, I answered all of the questions correctly for the bleeding test, however it only said that I had one correct answer.  The reason I know I was correct on the other questions, aside from being confident in this knowledge already, was that the test showed the answers for the ones you get wrong, and ""correct"" for what you get right.  In the written answer area, it stated all of the correct answers, which were the ones I gave, but it didn't give me the credit for them.  When I tried several more times it would only give me credit for one more answer, even though they all should have been correct from the start.  I tried the allergy test, another area that I am competent in, and it did the same thing, but this time for  2 of the 5.  It's a shame!  The tests are a fun idea, but don't work.  I'd give this app 5 stars if everything was in working order.",2,2014-12-10,1
80,SydneyKiley,"I decided to download this app because I recently became a swim instructor and CPR/AED/FA certified at my local gym. It's very nice for someone like me who could possibly have to deal with a situation like the ones mentioned in the future, and then being able to pull up the procedure on my iPhone is awesome because I forget things easily. I've taken the all the tests on the app (and have gotten 100%), and for the broken bone test I selected the two correct answers for what to do to when someone comes up to you with a broken arm, which is to hold it and support it with a cushion. The app still marks it wrong even though I've put in those answers about 10 times. Other than that this app should be on every single persons phone in the entire world because emergencies happen everyday and you can never be prepared for them without this app or proper training.",4,2016-01-07,1
81,Sammyr123,"The Red Cross takes the same line that many corporations and all governments do. Namely, you're too stupid to understand all but the simplest information. You can't be trusted to handle anything requiring thought or imagination! So, just shut up and do what you're told and nobody will get hurt. 
Unfortunately, in many cases, people WILL get hurt without enough information then and there at the scene while waiting for the ambulance to arrive! So, instead of offering enough facts for you to try to help the injured person, they usually just give the skimpiest of information and tell you to have someone else (NOT YOU, remember, you're too stupid to be able to make a call while you sit there ""reassuring"" the person) call 911!!! 
I don't understand how people can not only listen to this patronization, but give it 4 or 5 stars!

82,Dhkbcddyhgdfhklplkllllpppp,"So, this is interesting. Now I live alone in my house with just me, my cats, and my dead hamster. I work as a self-employed construction worker, and I was just getting back from knocking down this wall when I heard the scream.

The hamster was caught underneath his pull up bar and was squirming. I rushed downstairs and started yelling: ""Tod are you okay?"". He spiritually answered me and I started screaming at the cats to get help. They ran and i moved in to help Tod.

With all my might, i pulled him out and brought him to the baby changing station i had installed in my kitchen. i took this grate class in medical scool so im rellly good at first ade. I kept pushing down on him while i was looking at this ap thing. It said to give CPR to the individual and push down as hard as possible and so i did and Tod was crushed to death when i brought a pickaxe from my job.

The more i think about it Tod was fine and i didnt need to do it. i keep him in a garbage bag and mourn his loss every day with his shrine in the kitchen. One of the cats never came back and the other four came back.

I think i should ""punish"" them. If they got help Tod would still be alive. stupid $^&^%$&**** cats.",4,2015-12-02,-1
83,Angel N Danny,"This app is good if u have taken first aid classes, you can use it as a basic (VERY BASIC) reminders. It does not give step by step on what to do. Even in the test question: chocking: it gives a scenario and ask what's the next thing to.. The only option that is close to being right... Truly is about the 4th step. U don't see someone chocking and just walk up to them and hit them on the back. 1st you introduce yourself 2) you ask them are they chocking 3) u ask them if it is ok with them that u help them 4) then you would administer the proper procedure. It also does not show u how or where to place your arm before firmly hitting them on the back. App truly lacks a lot so please don't use this as your only tool for what to do in any emergency!

While in most circumstances that will be fine in the event of an disaster ie. a hurricane when power and network connectivity is unavailable the first aid information wouldn't be available.  

Otherwise spectacular app.  Red cross please format for IPad and make first aid info downloadable.  I'd even be willing to donate/pay for app with first aid content being downloaded to the device.",4,2012-10-30,-1

86,The Lovely Novice,"I so wanted to rely on this app. I had installed this app because I felt that I could trust it to provide the emergency information I needed should one ever arise. I felt secure in that. So, when I faced an emergency poisoning incident I was surprised, and disappointed, that this app didn‚Äôt come up to my expectations. In this case, the emergency didn‚Äôt require a 911 call nor a trip to the ER. All that I needed was a simple step by step guide to address the situation. This app didn‚Äôt deliver. I ended up having to find what I needed on the internet. Now, I was glad that at least there were instructions to call 911. And, there are ways to determine if that‚Äôs even needed. The information is general and basic; not at all what I expected. I could have saved time by going directly to my browser for answers.",2,2016-04-18,-1
87,Tom Boz,"The emergency preparedness kit list is good, but since it is a list of very basic suggestions, I would add a propane camp stove, several small fuel canisters, matches, and at least one battery powered LED lantern. Being able to cook food is a huge stress reliever, especially in a cold climate.

One gallon of water per person per day does not allow washing anything, so also paper plates, cups, napkins, disposable cutlery, and trash bags. 

All of the above could be added for less than $150 (the stove and fuel would be about half the total) and would make a very meaningful difference in stress levels. Not everyone would spend the money or storage space, but those who do would be far better prepared. Reducing stress levels is critical. Hot food and a decent light help a lot.

I would also consider tranquilizers for pets if people need to evacuate- especially for house cats. And a small cage.",4,2012-11-06,1
88,evdanielsson,"I don't know who, if anybody, reads these, but, here it goes! 

This is one of the coolest utility apps I've found! It's amazing! It has steps for just about every emergency! I know I will be using this a lot! I'm also looking forward to the tornado, flood, hurricane and earthquake apps! 

I would like to see ""Stings & Bites"" under the list of emergencies, as opposed to the ""ad type thing"" at the top of the page. As that is probably a common emergency. 
I would also like to see sunburns added. I got one of those today, and to my surprise, help for that wasn't in this app! 
Please add blisters too! :D
Something about ""Wild animal bites"" might also be helpful. I was bitten by a stray/ferrel cat a while ago, and didn't do anything about it, not knowing what to do. I did a school report on rabies a while afterwards, and it got me thinking, what if I get bit by another animal. :)

Having three and a half pets (one cat lives mostly outdoors), I was very happy to see the ""Pet preparedness"" category! This app has it all!!!!!!",5,2012-07-13,1
89,Revmat,"I recently took a Red Cross class and I wanted to see if anything stuck. I went straight to the tests. Surprisingly enough I only missed one question (I had the person keep their burn under cool water for a few minutes too long).
It really shouldn't be used in an emergency, but is a good reminder of what to do if you find yourself needing to treat someone in an emergency.

You should always get certified by a professional and do the hands on training, but the certification could be 1-2 years, so it's good to take refreshers if you're not an EMT or RN.

Good basics and simple run down of what to do. I recommend this not for those who have no background, but for those who need the refresher. However, if you can't afford to take the classes or are cannot get to any in your area, this is the next best thing.

Key point of reference, know when to call emergency numbers!",5,2015-12-07,1
90,Nikolai Shkurkin,"Well organized and for the most part holds basic information relevant information to each topic. 

When I was looking over ""stings"", you guys failed to specifically tackle a certain type of sting. Although asphyxia and trouble breathing generally fall into the symptoms, a sting in the mouth can result in progressive swelling of the tongue and lining of the throat, eventually choking somebody to death if not taken to the hospital. What i was really looking for was a specific reference to an ""oral stings"" which warned people of the severe danger of this type of sting.",5,2012-06-29,-1
91,Revan1123,"I love this app! Aside from it being sweet and concise, god forbid there should be an emergency, it has a very nice and appealing interface. Colors are nice and the layout is easy to read for quick reference. Pictures and videos and animated pictures for the different types of first aid emergencies. Red Cross must've paid a lot to the developer (3sided cube) for this app. But because there are no ads, I'm proud to say this non profit org has my respect still. Thank you for helping us properly care for one another Red Cross. :)",5,2012-12-23,1
92,Maria Teresa 213,"All ages should down load this!! It's a great app for the normal person, being an emt I feel everyone should be somewhat educated, & be able to maintain life before we arrive! Also to all the people knocking the app, this is for the person who is not am emt or medic, it's to help that person in a medical emergency, till Ems personal is on scene!! So calling people ""idiots"" and they need to grow up is not so very mature, maybe you need to do the growing up!! Thank you red cross for making this app available!",5,2012-07-07,1
93,R.C.3377,"First aid has been an interest of mine for years, so I downloaded this app as a reminder and to verify that what I know is current, as guidelines do change.

The information given, so far as I can tell, is absolutely correct and formatted well for ease-of-use. The problem is what is not mentioned. What do you do if, for whatever reason, emergency services are unavailable? (Longer-term advice for things like bleeding, trauma, and other injuries commonly sustained during disasters would be appreciated!)

I also noticed that basic CPR method is taught here, but only if you know what you're looking for.",3,2012-11-06,-1
94,Ptelin,"I have been waiting for something like this for awhile. I have it loaded on all the family phones. Just going through it caused old notions and home remedies to be questioned. It's fantastic, I think the sooner they come out with other scenarios the better. I agree with some of the other pots, that it could be expanded on for different level care but I am sure the consideration between proper training and basic aid must be taken into account. Anything above first responder may cause more harm than good.",5,2012-07-05,1
95,Steve75x,"I'm giving 4 stars more for the idea of this app and to encourage them to keep developing it. If you know absolutely NOTHING about first aid then this app will help you otherwise it's still a good re hash of what you probably already know.  I think it would be great for kids of babysitting age to have as a reference and go thru all the quizzes to get a solid basic first age foundation.

Recommendation to app developers add some advanced tabs or maybe consider a first responder app that gives more in depth stuff.",4,2014-10-17,1
96,DarkwingKevin,"Lots of quickly accessible lifesaving protocols for first responders. 

Get this app for your family members, and spend a few minutes understanding how it works. It may seem silly to think that you may be in a situation where you need to consult an app to save someone's life, but I think you'll be glad you've got it if you do. 

The other poster me mentioned the hospital locator feature. It gives me hospitals that are indeed nearby, but are not the closest.",4,2017-03-13,1
97,Jo in Alaska,"As a red cross instructor for over twenty years this is the best idea red cross as ever come up with.  I am share the little knowledge tests with my five year old grandson and he loves showing me he knows what to do in an emergency.  All I can say is lets get the other apps online and promote this apps to everyone you know.  Would be great if the check lists were printable and there was a link to online disaster training classes.  Love it, love it and did I mention I love it.  My family loves it as well.",5,2012-08-03,1
98,miss_bunches,"I haven't needed this app, and hopefully I never will, but if I ever do you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll use it! It's extremely helpful and you can prepare yourself by reading up on first aid in practically any situation. There are also short quizzes to see how much you know and how prepared you already are. Every person needs this because you never know when something may happen.",5,2012-07-22,1
99,MegRose77,"This is without a doubt, my favorite app. I believe it is extremely accurate, and if put in the situation, life saving. Children are constantly in my care and if I were alone with them and something happened, I know I would turn to this app for guidance on what to do and quickly. Seriously if someone reads my review, you need to see it to believe it. At least get it to look at it, it's free so you have nothing to lose!",5,2012-07-04,1
100,cjcoffman,"It's unbelievably basic. This won't really help in an emergency situation as it takes too long to get to the very limited information, although I feel it's purpose is not to be used in an emergency. 

Most subjects just refer you to call 911 which is the best thing if you don't have proper training. 

I'd like to see an app that focuses attention on what to do when one is out of communication range and needs to take care of both immediate and extended care; i.e., wilderness medical practice.",4,2015-10-02,1
101,Country&Western,"I've been a certified EMT and CPR instructor and I can't find anything wrong with the first responder advice this app gives. 
I like the way it's organized because it's easy to understand for all ages and skill levels. It doesn't just tell you HOW to do something, it also explains WHY you need to do it. Because, when you know ""WHY"", it's easier to learn and remember ""HOW""...
 
I really enjoy taking the tests both before and after going through the learning sections. The reward badges are very positive and motivating when achieved.

The reason I only gave 4 stars is because it isn't designed for use on an iPad, although it still works on one. Once that is fixed, it will have an easy 5 star rating from me.

Everyone should have this app!!!!!",4,2012-07-13,1
102,Stablemind,"This is very, very basic info, but it is the basics everyone should know at the very least...even if it only keeps people from doing more harm than good!  You have to start somewhere and this is good, solid, simple information presented as easily and understandably as it could possibly be presented. Just make sure anyone you know knows this info inside and out and everyone will be better off!",5,2014-01-26,1
103,dza1994,"Just amazing. Even has a dial 911 feature for those who have an iPhone. Instructions are foolproof and step-by-step. Just reading everything felt so easy to understand and simply blew my mind.
Now any iOS user can become a potential hero, even without training.
Amazingly well done guys. Would be even better if the info was offline as well (if it isn't already). A must have for all iOS users.",5,2012-06-16,1
104,SgtChez,"I got this app to help remind me of basic 1st aid and CPR techniques. The learning sections are great for basic 1st aid that your average untrained person can use to be effective in an emergency situation. 

If you're looking for an app to help you do surgery in the woods with a Swiss Army knife, this ain't the app.  But as a good refresher and reference app, I think it's solid. I particularly like the test to make sure you're getting it.  It ain't Med school, but I personally like it!",5,2016-08-11,1
105,Richard Beaudry,"This app is amazing. You can receive info on how to treat all sorts of things from burns to wounds, and you can learn how to prepare for natural disasters. You can even take tests to make sure that you know all of the things that they tell you!! Another great feature is that you can tap the emergency button to get quick, life saving advice in an emergency. This app is incredibly useful and definitely deserves 5 stars!",5,2012-06-18,1
106,LadyDawn,"The information alone is priceless. Then the simplicity of the instruction, pictures and the common question and answer section used together makes it simple to learn how to administer first aid to a person in need. Then once you've studied prove you know first aid by taking the quizzes. 
Everyone should have this app! 
Thank you for developing this invaluable tool.",5,2015-05-01,1
107,Mr. Tim F,"The Red Cross comes through again. I have used their publications for years and the mobile apps they have created are great. I live in NorCal and earthquakes are a concern.

So people trust me to know this stuff. Of course I have had first aid training, but in the heat of the moment it can slip your mind. I love having this app so that I can brush up on my skills just a little bit everyday. It helps me feel so much more prepared and safe.",5,2014-08-18,1
109,gitrslngr,"It's helpful if you're in a place where 911 can easily be called and help can arrive but... What happens if you're camping in the wilderness or are far away from any hospitals...? Like the person said below, give us more knowledge. Also in the test section, some of the answers to choose are pictures, not words, and I can't see the picture. Fix this big and offer more information for people who are far away and cannot get help. Watch ""I shouldn't be alive"" and see what I mean...",3,2013-08-04,1
110,NortonKarp,"Everything about this app is useful when minutes count. I find myself using it just to educate myself if something happens to come up. 

There is one issue, would someone check the spelling and grammar (I saw some mistakes in the Diabetes section).

Otherwise I would greatly recommend this app. I'm even going to upload it to my wife's phone for if I experience a Diabetic episode.",5,2012-07-03,1
111,Realtree Josie,"It's a awesome app but the only problem I have is the quizzes answers are sometimes too easy. Like ""how do you stop bleeding?""
A. Go to the mall
B. Apply pressure with a clean cloth

And I kinda wish they would tell you what to do if you can't call a ambulance (like no cell service or in the wilderness). But this is still a awesome app that I definitely think everyone should have! üòÉ",5,2015-08-21,1
112,Jamesthegirl721,"I like all the prepping info and all the emergency tips etc. However, anytime I try to select one of my locations, the app crashes. The ""up to date"" maps of active storms are useless.

Having the prep info, and the aftermath help is great, but don't rely this for info during the storm.",3,2012-11-09,1
113,Nelson132002,This app is mind blowing. One day on June 23 I really needed this app because my friend had a heat stroke and I didn't know what to do so I took him under a tree and I called 911. They told to look for something to help him while they send officers to where I was. I found this app and before the ambulance arrived he was a lot better. Without this app my friend would be in the hospital. THANK YOU RED CROSS.,5,2015-06-30,1

If you could, please fix this that would be good, Thankyou.",5,2016-01-30,1
117,The Lisha,"Best app I have. Very informative, thorough. and useful. I especially found the emergency feature strait forward. It is set up to guides a person through emergency care by asking questions specific to that situation and guiding them through the procedures step by step and providing illustrations, some of which are animated.  So even if you panic you won't skip an important step. Amazing!!!",5,2012-06-29,1

What would be even nicer would be hospital groupings.

Unfortunately, nothing loaded. I searched ""allergy"" and ""allergic reaction"" and nothing ever populated in the description.  Nothing. Ever.

159,IM AWESOME 101,"This app is so helpful. I can't wait till the  other apps cone out. I use and study with it everyday! If possible, i would give it 10 stars. 100% good.

160,Shooter McCravin,"The app is great, but there needs to be considerably more information for different types of incidents. Fainting, head trauma isn't thorough enough on someone who may be confused, and so on. I understand there are limitations, and that a course is much better than an App. But having extra is always great. The Emphasis on 911 is great.",4,2014-01-25,1
161,MichaelGK,"As someone certified in first aid and CPR, this app is my virtual pocket book to stay refreshed on everything.

163,CherokeeMom6,I would like to think its a useful application on a smartphone.

Keep up the good work and keep updating with more useful knowledge.,5,2012-06-19,1
164,Electrall,Great resource to use to stay on top of information and to be able to access it handily if needed in an emergency. Nearest hospital information based upon your current location can save a lot of stress and get patient help faster.,5,2015-02-17,1

166,Quadriance,"Great first aid application. However, it would be great if you could search for a term (i.e. Blister or altitude sickness) and get a description of what to do next. It seems to be missing some very basic first aid descriptions.... Muscle cramps, blisters, altitude sickness, etc.

170,David Wheeler,"I've been a lifeguard now for 6 years and an ARC trainer now for 3. It is a good app for a refresher and additional information but by NO MEANS a substitute for real training.

I gave it 3 stars because I think it can be improved,3,2012-08-30,1
179,Brett Jurgens,"This is a great app with a vast amount of knowledge. However, the testing portion is completely broken, does not work at all.

184,C4ll Of Duty 35 ;-),"This is a great and handy app. I've literally helped 4 people already with a broken bone, choking, burns, and bleeding.

For example, according to this app if someone is choking you are supposed to give 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts for any age. The correct treatment for choking is the Heimlich maneuver on pediatrics and adults and 5 back blows with the head down and face up and 5 abdominal thrusts.

194,PhosphorescentOne,"This app should come pre-installed on every iPhone. One thing: you forgot Avalanche Preparedness! This is something every winter sportsman or sportswoman should be prepared to handle!

Some of my suggestions:

‚Ä¢ Watch for loose packed snow.
‚Ä¢ Stay on trails unless you are a seasoned expert.
‚Ä¢ Always make sure someone knows where you are and when you should return.
‚Ä¢ Wear a GPS locator!
‚Ä¢ Don't try to outrun an avalanche downhill if you can get out of the way by cutting diagonally.

198,Michaeloftroy,I was extremely impressed at the broad depth that this app covers. From detailed first aid help to emergency preparedness.

What if you're in DC, severe thunderstorms have just moved through and the Power Grid is down for a week. That'll never happen, right?

Since when is calling someone considered FIRST aid?

Pitiful.

[UPDATE]

Okay I just read through 500+ reviews of clueless people who apparently do not know EXTREMELY BASIC FIRST AID, or what numbers to press to call Emergency Services. I also have not seen my own review despite having to spend 10 minutes to wade through over a week of responses just to get to today's date. 2 stars=>1 star.

1520,Joseph040313,"Very good FREE app for pocket reference. It has tests, which according to recent research (this writing as of 02/2015), is better for memory retention than just re-reading. Has various subjects for the non-first-aid person . Has an Emergency section that you can use in a hurry with a Call 911 button.

Even has an achievement system, if you're into that.

Only issue I've experienced is cross-referencing. E.g.: Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke (You have to go into one to see the other).

If you're interested in basic first-aid, this is a good app to read/study through.",4,2015-02-09,1

1532,r3boys,"1. This is not a completely reliable database for the official medical techniques and knowledge it advertises. Too afraid of imperfect and causing someone to get hurt over an ignorant rescue when that is going to cause a worse problem. They would rather you call 9-1-1 and wait for the police then tell you what you REALLY should do to a bleeding wound, snake bite, heart attack, etc... I should hope one wouldnt solely rely on this app for a camping trip or if they are hours away from a quality hostpittle. Don't download this without looking at it first. The info on treating a heart attack literally say this: 1. See if they have unexplained pain (and do not mention the left arm sign) 2. Call 911 3 give them aspirin 4. Reassure them. Really? 

2 unclean design, lack of content and videos. There is no section that portrays how to deal with no-serious injures, such as swelling or icing after a run. Few videos and photos are all blown up with low resolution. 

3.It should be fully functional without internet. I know this is an iphone app, but don't shut it off if I'm using an ipad and I'm away from wifi. 

All in all Im disappointed because i see HUGE value in it. If it was sleek enough to droll over, wise enough to tech you and not be worried that someone will use it ineffectively(some knowledge is better than none, add to the disclaimer), accessible, updating frenquetly, FULL OF DETAIL, and put forth the actual bank of knowledge that educators have stored, it would be well on its way yo educating children and adults alike, and maximizing its usefulness. Teenagers in particular think first aid is a very vool subject when presented correctly, with all the facts. Its like a martial arts discipline.This app could be legendary, so throw some funding in or get rid of it, the camper manual is out-doing it so far except the awesome tests. Don't ice it with any childish features. Make it excessively informative and professional sounding, as though you were reading a wikipedia page decorated with red and silver. (Wolfram aha connectivity)  This could be an outlet for people to relish in medical knowledge as a hobby, and it couldn't hurt to have more life guards in everyday life!",2,2014-07-23,1

Having taken ARC first aid & CPR classes in the past, this app is a good refresher and very useful for those who haven't taken such classes and are trying to get ahead of the curve in an emergency.   

Like to see added:
In going through the app to see what first aid topics it covered, I noticed that it did not have anything for any of the heat-related emergency situations: heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat rash.  These are covered in the American Red Cross ""Heat Wave Safety Checklist"" (at RedCross.org > Preparing > Preparedness Fast Facts) so it is surprising it's not covered in the app.  Of course, it could be that the only reason I noticed its absence is because it was almost 100F today, one of many very hot days we've been having lately.  Hope to see heat-related illness added in an upcoming update.",4,2012-06-17,1
