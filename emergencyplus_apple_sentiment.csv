0,deangadams,"Love this app and especially the addition of W3W. Would be awesome to have this as a widget to always show your location and also watch integration so you can have a complication on the Home Screen showing what three words locations for people hiking, exercising etc. easy way to get the information when you‚Äôre already on the phone is to raise your wrist.",4,2020-11-08,1
1,STEltham,"I recently loaded this app onto the shortcut screen of our family phones (mainly for the kids) with the expectation that I would never end up using it. 
This weekend, we had a fire in our garage where my husband was trapped and our garage door bolted closed, our home phone was out due to no power (thanks NBN) and I was trying to get my husband free. I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldn‚Äôt find their phone so I grabbed mine.  Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm -
It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door.
Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe. 
A brilliant app.",5,2019-06-04,-1
2,Andy Tibicen,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.,5,2021-09-18,1
3,Bigdog1971,"On last Friday night I suffered a crashing stroke. I was out on the bathroom tiles and couldn't talk, thankfully my wife was right there. She was a little flustered (understandable) and could not remember the number to call. She had this app on her phone and switch straight to the app and called the emergency number directly, also read the home address straight from the app screen.
I apologize if my words are mixed up, but I'm still recovering from the stroke.
I owe my wife for her recognition of what was happening and straight through to the help needed.",5,2017-09-12,1
4,[ The Captain ],"I had a serious fall mountain biking a couple of days ago. I managed to walk to the nearest fire road in a conservation area and gave my coordinates to the 000 operator. Our excellent ambo service had a 4WD in the park in good time, but took another hour and a half trying to track down which fire road I was on. I was in contact by phone but our maps were different. Eventually other riders spread out to guide them in.
Would have been much better if they had something to plug my coordinates in and guide them to me on an up to date map.",3,2020-06-11,1
5,GI Judy,Caution when reading out what 3 words over a phone to emergency services: their word list has similar sounding and pluralized words that may be misread by the operator and there are many examples of positions several km away with similar sounding names. There is security research on this topic. I would suggest incorporating other open source position readout protocols with better core technology.,4,2022-07-09,1
6,Stampman2001,"* Valuable app which works well. 

* No clear channel provided to give feedback to app developer team - 000 website ‚Äòcontact us for feedback‚Äô page sends you off to a myriad of pages on Department of Home Affairs website :(

* Feedback on behalf of a visually impaired member of community: the location details may not be very easy for some people to see.

* Perhaps a future release possibly include an accessibility option whereby the user could press a button for the location details to be read out by the phone? [Google maps is able to read out directions even when the phone is on a call, so such a feature may be possible(?).]",5,2018-04-05,-1
7,.......................123,Used this app in a remote National park in outback Qld when a group member collapsed. We got straight through and we‚Äôre able to clearly communicate our location in the park (not near any of the camp grounds or roads etc) to the paramedics. We had no coverage and the sat phone wouldn‚Äôt work but this app connected! Everyone who journeys in remote Oz should have this app.,5,2021-08-01,1
8,d-tjarlz,"I would like to see functionality for this app to send location coordinates as an SMS to a programmed list of contacts. This button should share space with the others on the main screen.

9,Shaza70,"I had to use the app recently with the bush fire crisis I live in a no mobile service area and land line was damaged due to the fires.  My husbands phone does not have mobile wifi so can‚Äôt use it to dial 000, and only works while the internet is up.  So downloaded the app thinking he can use it to dial 000 and found he couldn‚Äôt the app told him to use his phone to dial 112 and that didn‚Äôt work either - saying not available in the area. So he had to use Facebook messenger to phone me to ask me to call 000 I was 30km away. Don‚Äôt waste your time",1,2020-01-14,-1
10,ThaaBaar,The what3words integration is genius and is exactly what I‚Äôve wanted when sometimes the apps location description is occasionally off or too vague. It will also absolutely be vital for those lost in bush land who make calls. An absolutely must have!!,5,2020-11-06,-1
11,photomuz,Terrific idea but would be of limited value without my glasses. The words are very small. How about increasing the size of the three words to fill the screen after 10 seconds and also reading the words out to help people with vision impairment or illiterate.,4,2020-11-02,1

103,Gregory Opera,"As a former emergency responder, I think ‚ÄòEmergency Plus‚Äô is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display one‚Äôs exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is ‚Äúcritical‚Äù information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even there‚Ä¶ For example, to find the ‚ÄòCPR guides‚Äô and ‚Äòfire alerts‚Äô, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking ‚ÄòMore Information‚Äô and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either ‚ÄòRoyal Life Saving‚Äô or ‚ÄòFire Alerts‚Äô.

This is way too many steps to access ‚Äúcritical‚Äù information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldn‚Äôt even realise that they could find ‚Äúcritical‚Äù information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see ‚ÄòApple Watch‚Äô support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use ‚ÄòEmergency Plus‚Äô independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to one‚Äôs Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also don‚Äôt understand why there is no support for ‚ÄòAmber Alerts‚Äô whatsoever.

I rarely know when ‚ÄòAmber Alerts‚Äô have been issued, because I don‚Äôt listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I don‚Äôt use social media, so the only time I know there‚Äôs an ‚ÄòAmber Alert‚Äô active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)‚Ä¶ If this application supported ‚ÄòAmber Alerts‚Äô or better yet, supported ‚ÄòAmber Alerts‚Äô AND ‚ÄòApple Watch‚Äô products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an ‚ÄòAmber Alert‚Äô is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, ‚ÄòEmergency Plus‚Äô could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etc‚Ä¶) to anybody in the affected area‚Ä¶ As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

‚ÄòEmergency Plus‚Äô is an invaluable application to install on one‚Äôs smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (‚Äúdraft‚Äù) application‚Ä¶ Whilst I‚Äôm sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2,2022-03-22,1

While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times.",5,2017-02-08,1
106,Maggiemg22,"I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea. She thought so too but her feedback was that the coordinates were very small and difficult to read, especially if you were in an emergency situation and feeling dizzy etc. It looks like there is room to make the co-ordinates larger and perhaps black on white text would be easier to read especially for older people or if you're glasses have been lost/broken in an accident. Thanks :)",4,2016-01-20,1
107,Cameron Hamill,"If the app could automatically share the app users GPS location with Emergency Services i.e. without the app users intervention, it would be 5 stars from me.

The app is a genius concept. I'm telling everyone I know about it. I have some friends from a non-English speaking background I'll be installing this app for them.",4,2014-09-25,1
108,Denyer's One,I had to call an ambulance for a life threatening emergency today. I was on an unfamiliar rural road and had so much trouble trying to explain my location. The guy almost died while the ambulance was delayed... I'm totally overjoyed to find this app as I can already see how essential it is... Should be compulsory for every motorist! Truly a great invention which will save lives!,5,2014-11-27,1
109,Ceewil,"The app info section says it was developed with valuable assistance of Vision Australia. Why then is the font so small and the GPS coordinates and address details so small?! In a stressful emergency, this info needs to be bigger. A previous review suggestion for the inclusion of the poison line and mental health emergency number numbers is a good idea. Overall though this app is a good. Having had to call 000 before on a remote road with no reference points, this app would have been very useful .",3,2014-03-10,1
110,R-Buddy,This app seemed like a great idea - very clear layout with easy to read GPS co-ordinates.  Was about to load the app onto my mountain biking son's phone and noticed the current location was way off.  Clicked on the map and noticed a disclaimer - 'accurate to 6000m' which makes the usefulness of the app questionable especially situations such as mountain biking reserves or national parks etc.  6km is quite a distance. Can't understand this inaccuracy - hopefully it can be fixed.,3,2015-10-17,1
111,Cheryl2815,"Today I used this app for this first time! A car accident in the middle of nowhere, I was as able to use this app to call emergency services and provide my location within 30 minutes police arrived with ambulance and fire truck a few minutes later!

A must have app for everyone!",5,2017-03-05,-1
112,**alc**,Great idea but GPS location coordinates on the home page are too small to read. Unless you have 20/20 vision it is too hard to see the location and numbers. Other reviews have said this too.  There is enough room on screen to increase the text size so why has this not been modified by the app developers? It is pretty crucial in an emergency to be able to read your GPS location.,2,2016-09-05,1
113,Jadzla,"If cross street, other emergency numbers like poisons, mental health and a spot for making notes of when u called were added then this would be 100% useful.

PLUS - where's a button for 112 when there's no mobile coverage? A total must.

Well done developers",4,2014-02-17,-1
114,Ee0542,"I haven't had to use this, but it would be great if you needed to. It loads really quickly so you're not waiting just to make the call, the location, for me anyway, was perfect, and it's laid out in an easy to use way, with various numbers in case you don't know whom to call. :)",5,2014-12-20,1
115,PeerReviewer,"When in an emergency and needing to read out coordinates to the 000 operator, many older or visually impaired people might not be able to read them out due to the numbers being very small. A person may not have their glasses with them or be able to find them in this emergency. An improvement on this app would be to enlarge these coordinate numbers. Thank you.",3,2017-01-22,0
116,Rural WA,This looks fantastic especially for isolated roads or beaches but I have a real concern that my young kids could accidentally ring emergency services if they play on my phone. Any chance of adding the option of using a password or something similar to access the app?,4,2015-08-14,-1
117,Tom dog,"Loaded up and found my location (street address) perfectly.
Could be very handy in a rural situation where accuracy using Lat / Long coordinates would be much better. Out of WiFi range will take GPS in phone longer to establish accuracy.",5,2015-01-25,1
118,kelrenzz,If there was an option to store your emergency info (like iEmergency) as well it would make it a very comprehensive app. And perhaps a source of information for emergency services if the patient was unresponsive on arrival. Please consider for next upgrade. I would happily pay to purchase.,4,2013-12-06,1
119,fLYINGzuCCHini,Why does the app still use gps in background when you don't give it those privileges? Still indicates it's in use even when not in the app and when you kill the apps. Battery drain not the best thing when you are in an emergency...,4,2015-07-27,-1

- a ""other"" numbers section.",4,2014-05-16,1

125,acscotty,Whilst the concept of this app is excellent I can not seem to get it to work in airplane mode or without sim.

Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"".  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once.

The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: ‚Äò13-2500‚Äô is listed when it should be ‚Äò132 500‚Äô. 

Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.
