negative,Gives wrong address so how do I know the rest is correct.
negative,"Locates correctly but can give an address 800m / 8 streets away. ""Last updated"" text can also be odd: ie ""19 years ago"". Must have to let it take time to settle down. SGS10."
positive,A good thank you
neutral,We
neutral,handy to have
negative,"Rendering assistance to a lone dehydrated aged sailor at water's edge reporting as a ""concern for welfare"". Frustratingly with no road and no x-street to pass to 000 it was simple as saying Alpha, Bravo, Charlie where GPS and three words was spot on in guiding the ambulance close. ""if we can't find you we can't rescue you"", and day or night not all calls for assistance come with an observable street address or for that matter even on ""Land"", that's within a three metre square. Well done W3W."
negative,Great app. Sister put me onto it. Shame there is no way to update the home location as a gps location does work for when you are multi level residential building.
negative,"Dangerous app. It thinks I am at my old address, some 50km from where I actually am. GPS won't update. Waze picks up my location correctly so it isn't a GPS or phone issue. This app is dangerous, it could send emergency services to the wrong location. It would be safer not to have the app and use street signs or landmarks or GPS coordinates from your phone to report your location."
positive,Great 'just in case' app. Truncation of 'what three words' in primary and map screen may be problematic (unless font size significantly reduced impacting vision impaired individuals). When tapping info box from map screen all text increases in size and often pushes last of the 'three words' out of view/access. Better highlighting of additional services accessible through the menu may also assist those who haven't explored app prior to their emergency/crisis.
positive,This is truly a life saving app
positive,Saved my life twice now how do you recommend it LIFE SAVING
positive,"The app isn't working right since last update. Map and numbers are half covered up and can't read 3 words at all as its so small. Please bring back the older version, or explain how I can revert it back as it no longer works"
negative,I just installed this and it has me at the wrong address
neutral,life saving
neutral,"As a motorcycle rider,this is an invaluable app to have on my phone"
neutral,"Crashes, unable to open"
negative,"Location is about 500m out. In a residential area, this would have emergency services turning up to the wrong house -in my case half a block away and the wrong side of the street!"
negative,This is a must have. If your unsure of the address were the emergency is just touch the app. There it is. All you need to get help.
positive,Most useful feature of the app GPS cordinates of the current location which is useful in an emergency.
positive,Most impressed
positive,Awesome app great to have on your phone
neutral,"Not displaying my location correctly, more than 3km out."
negative,"Your app sometimes displays the ""what3words"" text wrong between the ""Home"" screen and the ""My Location"" screen. At times on the ""My Location"" screen, the 3rd word is missing letters at the end of the word. But on the ""Home"" screen all letters appear. Thus, different words can be displayed when at the same location on the 2 different screens. If this review is monitored and your require clarification I have screenshots to illustrate."
positive,Awesome... everyone should have this app as it may just save your life or the life of a loved one .
positive,Thank you You
negative,"Info blurb says (in the ""app permissions"" section) that you can disable access to permissions in settings. After downloading, the ONLY settings option is to change the font size of GPS coordinates... a blatant lie - not cool. Why should this app need access to the storage of my phone??"
negative,"The so is generally good. I'd give it 5 stars but... the app has no exit option. Once started this app runs continuously until a Force Stop is used in settings, applications. This app only needs to run on demand NOT continuously. Please fix this flaw. It affects battery."
positive,"Just installed the app. My street number is 20. The app says I am 22, and I am sitting in the middle of my house."
negative,I havent use it yet. Is there anyway/any app that can work from satellite signal on the phone where has no reception? Just for emergency in remoted area
neutral,000 should be swappable with the national relay service. All together items should be swappable on the first page
positive,Worth having it.
positive,"Great system, easy to use."
neutral,A must have for all
positive,"Great app spot on for locations, it is really good to have"
positive,"Great and simple app, but accessibility is poor. It would be vastly better for older folk (or the vision impaired) if the required information wasn't in tiny text that's hard to read. It wastes a lot of screen space that could be better used."
positive,Good to use easy to connect with people
positive,Love this app as you can provide a precise location if required. One thing that could make this more useful would be the ability to put a widget on your lock screen to allow instant access if needed similar to the emergency call option on lock screens. I have a medical app that provides my medical history etc and the widget gives instant access to my information in an emergency without having to unlock my phone.
negative,"This is an app everybody should have on their phone. For the average, untrained person, it can be extremely difficult to think rationally in an extreme emergency due to adrenaline coursing through your system that often leads to panic. Giving information such as your whereabouts if you are in an unfamiliar place can make things worse. This app can lessen that sense of panic by giving you everything you need at your fingertips and if you don't know where you are what3words is just brilliant."
positive,Good
neutral,Incredible life savings tech
negative,"It has got my address wrong, it thinks I live at 157 which is actually the 2 duplex dwellings behind me, I live at 159. There is no way to change this?? My wife or I could be dead by the time the emergency services find us?"
positive,Very comprehensive and very easy to use.
positive,"App doesn't show my position (as indicated in app preview). Location is selected ""On"". Any thoughts or suggestion from anyone. Cheers"
positive,This is a great app but it needs to have the ability to be used on a phone that is locked with a password so a child can ring for help
negative,Just call 000 actually tried to use this app during an emergency and it didn't work. I ended up calling 000
positive,"The concept of this app is sound and useful, however it's very hard to read for those who have less than ideal eyesight. Surely this must be obvious? An emergency app. is for everyone, not just for those with perfect vision! Get with it!"
negative,App is recommended by Australia Wide First Aid... gives your exact location when talking to required emergency
positive,"Please change the map/location functionality so that one tap anywhere on the lower half of the screen immediately makes it full screen with large text. At the moment it requires two taps to do this which hardly anyone is going to know. Also add large text ""Tap here for location information"". Great app otherwise."
negative,"Location map is utterly broken and therefore pointless, and dangerous to rely upon. Just use Google Maps and share your location with a friend via SMS if you're lost."
positive,I can't copy my long-lat or what3words to a text message. Please allow/ encourage copy for this. Data takes less power and signal.
positive,On a Samsung Galaxy there are already 3 apps that are Orange. This important app should be perhaps red and blue so it stands out on screen.
positive,I havent used it yet... but it looks cool
positive,Essential App gives your precise location for Emergency Services personnel to come right to your side. Amazing precision and vitally important when out Bushwalking and in areas of dense scrub.
negative,I was recently teaching at a school and a student asked me if they had no credit on there phone does this app still work.
positive,What three words will save your life allowing emergency services to locate you quickly
positive,Works as it should. Thanks.
negative,"Twice I have pocket dialled Triple Zero presumably with this app. This is a problem. If I hadn't noticed, the Triple Zero worker would be concerned"
positive,Look good so far
positive,This is a great app but is there some way of getting the 3 words other than using your gps location. I would like to add the three word for location to evacuation plans.
positive,This app is like my former girlfriend's clit....goes off at the slightest touch ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ƒ...accidentally sending alerts often
positive,Good idea. Hope i never need to use it.
negative,"Unable to alter address, picks up the house behind mine and not my home, so useless for me"
negative,"GPS detects next door address as My Location, cannot adjust. No good in an emergency!!"
negative,Not really sure how to rate this as I've never had to use it
negative,"Sorry, not happy Jan. what3words is a confusing addition to what was a user-friendly app - since usurping my Emergency+, I have not had a correct street address reflected and I now live about a kilometer away at the entrance to the dog-walking park instead of at an address, with actual Unit #, that used to be reflected. The 3 words applicable to my life vary from front to back door and indeed upstairs to downstairs. Now not confident that the authorities would find me in an emergency."
negative,Everyone needs this! Used when I came across a vehicle that had hit a poll at night. Was alone in the dark in a rural area and I could tell emergency services where I was. Everyone needs this app
positive,"Best App, all my Family has it."
positive,Great app get it ready for when you need it.
positive,"Good start. You need to add a share button to copy the what3words location, or to automatically share with a person ( via messenger or WhatsApp for example) or even share directly to emergency services. As well, add a live tracking service so that when we are out by ourselves we can share realtime location with a friend. Also have it so it alerts the friend with a notification after X minutes of not moving. Let the tracked user set how many mins of standing still before alert is sent."
neutral,"Sitting in Birdsville, the app told me I was in Alice Springs Genius Uninstall"
positive,Cool
positive,I hope it works when needed..
negative,"Not the smartest design for what is supposed to be an emergency app. For one, and probably most importantly it should 'force start' location services (GPS) rather then relying on user activation. A kid may not know how to do this, or become confused. What3words is a joke. Fine if you speak fluent English, but not everyone does. Why couldn't a system of 2 letters and one number have been implemented instead, such as A3E. Cleary readable and pronounceable by everyone."
neutral,Need to put correct address 7 Waterbrook Close Idalia
neutral,Not accurate with location! At least a minimum of one street away!
positive,Awesome app emergency services helps pinpoint your location by three words marking system easy to repeat over the phone. Just wait upto 30 seconds for it to work the GPS. It gives location without cell connection.
positive,"Integrating W3W isn't a crash hot idea. It's literally a proprietary system. Plus codes would have been smarter, conforms more with the Digital Service Standard (due to it being open source) and relies less on people being fluent in English. Not just me though, reading some of the other reviews complaining about the different words appearing suggesting better word combinations, but that's now something that the devs now have zero control over."
positive,So useful. Has all the information you need and couldn't make assisting in an emergency easier!
positive,Great app
positive,The location was responsive and accurate
positive,Great app
positive,Brilliant
positive,Appears to be good. I haven't tested it in an actual emergency yet but it got my address right which is a good start.
positive,"Upon opening the app for the first time it had me located across the street at my neighbours house but I closed and opened again and the location was correct so all good. My concern would be the words used, I watched a few times and some of the words I felt may be too hard to pronounce for some people, so maybe an update could keep words under maybe 5 letters. Otherwise, what a brilliant app :)"
neutral,Transmitted SOS signal to my contact several times without me operating it!!
positive,My location spot on. Hope I don't have to use it !
negative,"The concept is great, but location details are incorrect & a few years out of date. My address dosent exist on this app at all. Until the app is updated, it's useless for Emergency services &clients"
negative,"I've just downloaded the app and it has located me in the wrong place at the other end of the street I live on. Not sure if that is normal, but not encouraging."
positive,Helpful
negative,"ALL FONTS NEED TO BE MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LARGER. I need glasses to read, but in an emergency may not have them or be able to reach them. The app doesn't allow ""pinching"" the screen to make the print larger. The screen desperately needs to be rearranged so that the info is MUCH MUCH LARGER"
neutral,Location is inaccurate. I refreshed it three times and it gave me different addresses
positive,Love the program but was unable to install on this telephone following issue with Google play
positive,Saved my life
positive,"Never had to use it yet, but like the idea"
positive,Great app but the latitude and longitude numbers are too small for some visual situations. How about displaying large numbers if you tap on them ?
negative,maybe one day we would be able to send a SMS emergency alert ??
positive,"Love the concept, haven't use this in emergency but i think the 3 word concept could be improved to be more inclusive for people with visual disability or non english speaking people...or if you are about to pass out. Say maybe press a button to send a location signal or it reads out the 3 words for the caller."
neutral,All and everybody's must have
positive,"Unfortunately, the location is way off. It continues to pin point me on the other side of town which would be a huge problem if it were an actual emergency. The concept is good though, the app itself is very responsive and easy to understand."
negative,"Downloaded to consider as an option for an elderly relative in a remote location who may need to call ambulance. Unfortunately, text size defaults are difficult to see and not clear if it can be changed... highly recommend updating to improve usability for sight challenged users and other user groups who could struggle with the interface. We will print what3words co-ordinate for our relatives property and put in their wallet and on their fridge, but not ideal if they are moving around."
positive,My husband had a need to call and ambulance. The app did everything it's listed to do and performed well.
positive,"I assumed it would AUTOMATICALLY SMS location to the operator. This is trivially easy to program. Instead it asks you to verbally relay it, with huge opportunity for errors and delay. Useless."
negative,"It's putting in my wrong home address while I am at home ,how can U fix this ?"
neutral,Fortunately I have not had to use this app. However it looks exactly what I would need should the occasion arise.
positive,Without having actually used it in an emergency ...initially it located me next door but after going back and forth between location and home ( where I was) on the app it adjusted to the correct address. I particularly liked being able to put the location display on large writing. When I wear sunglasses I can only read large print. Also good to press just one button.
negative,"Unfortunately this app puts me 7 houses away from my correct location, and there is no way to correct this ,that I can see. Not good enough for an emergency situation. Ill tell emergency my 3 words from that app myself."
positive,"It works well for me. Address is spot on each time I check. Thankfully I didn't need to use it for real emergency yet, but it's easy to use and could be very helpful. Thank you"
negative,"Location on map appears correct, but address (street number) is incorrect - the inconsistency makes one wonder how this may impact on timely emergency services response in an emergency."
positive,Thanks to the team at the National Triple Zero Awareness Work Group for updating the app. It is now working very well on my phone. Hope I don't have to use it.
positive,Ever since this app was updated it is now giving incorrect addresses. It is telling me that I'm at 36 when I'm at 47. When I was in a different area it was telling me I was at number 5 when I was at 25 that is a big difference. Not very good if you do not know where you are and need help. You need to look into this and make it more accurate it's not only on this advice it was on two other advice .
positive,Excellent
neutral,Coast guard not on list for darwin...
positive,So disappointed in the complete change of the logo. Been trying to get people on board and now it looks like a different app. Was so easy to tell people what the old logo looked like. Also had thought the what the words was spam advertising until someone said you can say the words. Who knew about that. More education required.
negative,This app now wants my location turned on all the time which I do not want to do so I have decided to uninstall it.
positive,A MUST HAVE for Everybody. Automatically sends your Location to Emergengy Services when it really counts. Saves Lives. ðŸ¥°
positive,Excellent
neutral,"Can't really rate this app, updated it n now I can't find this app's icon on my home page"
positive,Great idea.
positive,Much better and thanks for listening to my queries.
negative,Before this app was upgraded I had no trouble with it but now it won't open on my phone a Samsung 6. I think it is a very important app and it is very frustrating that I can't get it to work.
positive,"It was brilliant but since the latest update will not open. Samsung Galaxy S6, android 7. Uninstalled and reinstalled the latest 23 Nov version. Still will not open"
negative,My location address is wrong!
positive,Text is pretty small by default. I don't think my parents would be able to use it without their glasses.
positive,This app fails to operate on samsung s5 and s7 mobiles. I am posting this from a Samsung a9 which works fine. Thank you for attending promptly to the issue.
positive,"This app is excellent and it is totally free. Congratulations to the developers for all the effort they put into making this a great experience and reassuring the public of quick responses from a great variety of emergency services available in the app. Thanking you kindly, Paul."
neutral,"It shows the property next door, why does it not show my property?"
positive,"Updated version (2.24) now works fine. Thanks for the update The app is an important one that I think everyone should have on their phone. Previously I wrote ""I have a Nexus 6P phone running Android 8.1. The old version of the app worked fine but the updated version says ""Emergency Plus has stopped"" I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times but to no avail. The app is a good app and I would like to see it work on my phone again or have some way of rolling back to the previous working version."""
neutral,Spot on
neutral,"Still keeps closing on my galaxy s7. I've uninstalled & reinstalled it & restarted phone, but still doesn't work"
negative,"I am getting the ""stopped working"" message on my Galaxy S6. Reinstalling had no effect."
positive,"Love this app, BUT I just moved to a new phone on on Android 10and now app crashes immediately on opening."
positive,My location is showing as the cul-de-sac behind my place and not my address so there should be the ability to change.
positive,"Map base incorrectly labelling addresses of properties. Otherwise looks like a great idea, but hard to give it a good rating if it will potentially send emergency services to the incorrect address."
negative,"Looks like a useful app, but missing a vital warning - nowhere does it warn that it cannot call 000 if there is no phone signal. Also, the colour scheme of the disclaimer makes it just about impossible to read."
positive,"Can we get the original app back please, it was great and worked perfectly every time. At the very least change the app colour back to something that stands out, not an orange colour that blends in with every other Google app out there...."
neutral,Crashes on startup
negative,"2Nov2020 I tap to open, it opens AND then closes. Useless. 18Nov2020. Thank you very much for the fix! It's working again!"
positive,Since the last update it crashes straight away everytime.
positive,"Using this on a Samsung tablet. I do not have What3words showing in the app. Uninstalled and reinstalled but still not showing. I have extracted the APK from the Emergency plus app on my phone, saved this to my tablet, ran it toinstall the app and it now works fine, so I can't believe that it is Google policy that was stopping it before."
negative,"Now that the failed update that caused the app to shut down has been fixed I'll change the rating. However, if another update renders the app useless again I will be uninstalling."
positive,New update is working just fine 16.11.20
neutral,"The app which worked once is still not working. It closes immediately it's opened, despite being uninstalled and reinstalled several times. My phone is as galaxy S7 running Android 8."
negative,Slow to open and does not fit on screen cutting half of the last three words off. Font is set to smallest. Not confident in using it in an emergency situation. Hope its just a settings thing. I have a galaxy s9
positive,"I just downloaded the latest update and the app won't open, just crashes on start-up. Android phone. Update... Version 2.23 is now working on my phone (Android 7.1.1) thanks for fixing it."
positive,"Can someone help. I have uninstalled then reinstalled, turned phone on and off and the app still won't open with s comment saying the app has stopped working. Any help would be great. Yes my phone is samsung s7. It used to work on same phone but not now and you had mentioned problems with 7 and 8. Looking forward to having it back. Thanks I now have it back as my app. So glad it's back."
negative,Preferred the look of previous emergency app. It was clear to see that it was for the emergency services. The new look app is unclear and meaningles.
neutral,Unable to access this new emergancy plus app. Samsung 7
positive,"Sad that an app can have so much negativity attached to it just for an upgrade fault. Now its fixed... those negative votes should be removed. Have not had an emergency yet, but the App works fine for me. Seems there was a genuine fault, but latest version as of 14/11/20 is working fine on my 2 year old MotoG7 phone. Simply tap the App.... and then tap the 000 button (or other if you wish) and you are ready to communicate with the operator. At the bottom of the screen was my exact position... wow. How good is that? I mean if you are lost, it is also helpul to see where you are. Should be compulsery for all phones in Oz. For a lousy $1.29 it is almost classed as free. Thanks to the providers of this app... feel safer already lol. Will be getting my partner connected also asap. BTW... only reason I get this is because saw it on TV this morning. Thanks channel 9 (smile)."
neutral,The app appears to now work following an upgrade.
positive,"Works well again with the latest update! I've recommended to family and friends, I think all Aussies should have this app on the home screen of their phone."
neutral,App doesn't open
positive,Awesome idea. The only downside is on my phone when i increase the 3word font size it cuts them off on the bottom on the home screen.
negative,I'm trying to install this Emergency Plus app and it doesn't go past install it won't open keeps shutting down fix it
neutral,Just updated my working app and now does not work... apparently the glitch still has not been fixed.
neutral,"It is not opening on my phone. Galaxy S7, Android v7. The fix has worked."
negative,"All fixed thank you. But... when you open the app, the heading is very faded and very hard to read. Is it possible to change the colour."
positive,"The latest revision of the app looks OK on a 6.7"" screen. On a 5.2"" screen the wording of the location and the co-ordinates are on top of each other. The 3 words are too small to see. Trying to touch or to move the text to see it clearly has no effect. The only helpful thing is to touch the map - but who knows that? On the following screen, the address, co-ordinates and the 3 words are visible as they should be. The location on the map is not shown, because it is not centered, and is out of bounds of the frame. The 3 word system is smart, however, as I hold the phone, the words are changing constantly. This could lead to misunderstanding with the operator. Australia is a developed and wealthy country. It should adopt a system where the location of the phone is sent out on a touch of a button. Can't imagine a person suffering stroke being able to operate this app and read out anything correctly."
neutral,"Installed app 13/11/2020, app opens and immediately crashes. So I can't really express an opinion on it because it on't work."
negative,Update: 13 Nov 2020 It is finally fixed and it works now. Doesn't work on my Samsung S5 I tried to install again on 12 Nov 2020 and it doesn't open. They said it was fixed. No it isn't.
negative,"Please consider restoring the previous app icon. The current one is useless, meaningless and plain ugly. The older icon immediately identifies the app as an Emergency App. Many others have commented on this issue."
positive,This app has just been updated but it still does not work on my Samsung S7 edge Problem solved. App now working as before. Several new good features added to this important app
positive,new version all good on Samsung S5. thank you for your speedy response.
positive,"The updated app closes as soon as I open it. Samsung s7. Reply from google, an identified issue with android 7 and 8. Will be an update soon. Thank you. Updated 12 Nov. Now works fine. Thank you."
positive,"New version doesn't open on my phone! Real issue for me as I work as a pool lifeguard. Also, the new logo is not an improvement, unnecessary. Thank you - issue fixed plus 3 word location technology added."
negative,"Since the new update, the app will not open and says ""Unfortunately, Emergency Plus has stopped working"" immediately. Worked great before and haved used in the past as I am in the emergency services. I have a Galaxy Note 4. Thankyou for your reply. Updated to the latest version and the problems are fixed and working fine, thank you."
negative,So. Update has been live for 2 months. Still not fixed. Any chance it will be fixed before the up coming fire season . Update 12/11/20 Still wont load. App closes even after latest update
neutral,"Previously the app wouldn't work on Android 6. I previously posted a 1star rating with a comment. Developers listened and afer a re-install, it works."
positive,The below issue has now been fixed and the app is now working on my phone. I am using Android 8.0.0 The previous version of the app worked great. This version won't open. Very disappointing for an Emergency app
neutral,Now working again. but location is not correct.
positive,Very useful
positive,"Thanks for fixing the bug guys,the app works very well & I think the changes are great..well done..10/10 guys."
positive,App crashes when I try to open it. Uninstalled app and reinstalled app with still the same problem 11/11/2020 Thanks for fixing above issue with the update today. GPS is slightly out by only 1 house though.
negative,Broken for 2 updates in a row for Android 8 users. Now how do I get help when I'm dying in a ditch on the side of the road?
positive,What three words function is great!
positive,"The new app like many other users found does not work. Could we have the old app back until such time as you get it fixed, lives are at stake. The old app worked great. As they say if it ain't broke don't fix it."
positive,"No, I wouldn't recommend this app anymore. It worked great before update i don't remember performing, now, i can't even use it, just says it's stopped. Why change something so important that doesn't need changing?"
negative,"Have had this app for many years, I have a Samsung 9, since the update this app has become totally useless, very disappointing!!!!"
negative,Useless. A waste of my Time. Doesn't work.
positive,"Used to work fine, but now won't open on my Android"
positive,This app was really good before it was updated. Now on my android phone the lat and long is unreadable Also what happened to all the other info like poisons centre.
positive,"App still works on my Android, W3W is a great introduction. However, when increasing the text size, it reaches a point where it won't display in the screen properly, as there's no ability to scroll down - yet lots of wasted up the top. Biggest complaint of the update is the icon change - more modern yes, but isn't obvious at all like the original that it's an emergency app. Even the new icon being red would be a better start. It seems to be a common piece of feedback from a lot of users"
negative,"Since last update,will not start. Tried to use during EMERGENCY 2 days ago and would not work."
negative,"This was a very useful app. Reliable and accurate. Now upgraded and totally useless. Unable to open, no mapping or coordinates Even the icon is not as distinctive. Please find a fix as soon as possible. Thank you."
positive,"This was a great app. Worked first time every time, anywhere. The new version is extremely disappointing. Have installed/uninstalled unsuccessfully numerous times in an attempt to get it to work. Even the icon is not as distinctive as the previous version. Used to recommend often during training courses. Please fix as soon as possible."
neutral,wont download
positive,"I had the old emergency app which was good, but then it was replaced by this one which won't open on my Samsung s5. So now I don't have an emergency app."
neutral,Doesn't open
positive,Continually stops!! Please rectify urgently!
negative,Until very recently it worked well on my Galaxy. Not now grrrr. Just fails immediately and has to be closed. Currently useless.
negative,Newest update fails to open now matter what I do. That's a problem for an emergency app.
neutral,"Can't even open app, keeps crashing."
neutral,Can't download the app
neutral,Wont install
neutral,"Had this app for a long time. Now, since the recent changes, app WONT OPEN!"
positive,"Used to work very well and was a reassuring app. Since the icon design changed and went orange, it's just nothing. It needs emergency repair especially for country travel and elderly."
neutral,"Similar to last comment. Had for years, since update will not work."
negative,"This is a life saving app and you can't get it working, very poor action not checking before release. It may be you that might need your life saved in a remote area. You people are supposed to be experts, fix it!"
neutral,App keeps dropping out.
positive,App won't open any more on Android 7 running on Moto g4+. An app like this should run on even the ancient versions of an O/S - we don't all feel compelled to by a new phone just because!
neutral,It can not be open!!!!
neutral,doesn't work after upgrade.
negative,It use to work up until a month ago. No longer works.
neutral,Newupdatedappwillnotopen
neutral,Keeps closing when i try to open app.
positive,"new app ,updated 2 days ago will not run failz and stopps on oening every time, was great now just bloat.."
positive,"Same as others - "" ... stoped"" message after update. (Worked perfectly prior to this.) Note to developers: this is happening on my Android 6.0.1; of which there are thousands still in service. Please fix service for Android 6 as well as 7 & 8. I also sent email with details of failed work around attempt, after re-installing. I opened directly via Playstore's ""OPEN"" button, instead of from new (orange) screen symbol. It opened, but would not allow set up."
neutral,Still not opening. I give up.
neutral,Won't open on my phone anymore. Crashes every time.
neutral,wont open or stay connected
positive,Looks simple and brilliant. Let's hope i never have to use it!
positive,Fantastic app
negative,Keeps closing saying it has stopped. Disappointing
negative,"Update to emergency one causes app to crash, unable to open app"
positive,"My is not working ever since the update .will not open I uninstalled and reinstalled, still the same issue. It use to work great now it's hopeless ??????"
positive,Sorry to report that the update has stopped the app completely on my trusty old Samsung S5 running Android 6.
positive,"Was brilliant when I installed it years ago since the update it crashes when I try to open it, not good if you have to use it in an emergency. Can you please fix the bug"
positive,"I can't access or update to the new 3 words app on my Samsung tablet? I've even uninstalled the 'old' app and downloaded the 'new' one but its not actually the new app, just the original?!?"
neutral,Location is incorrect by approx 150m.
neutral,The app will Not open for me
negative,"With an update, the app now fails to open or work. Do the developers understand what an emergency app is for? Do NOT release updates until they work reliably. It needs to be simple, reliable, robust and work without fail. This is useless!"
negative,No longer working on my Samsung galaxy s5 android 6.0.1
neutral,"Ya bunch of IT nongs forgot to test the ""updated"" app before release. Doesn't work on my Samsung S6. Given it's an emergency app one would think your release process would be a tad more robust."
neutral,Can't open
negative,"Will not currently open crashes on demand, something wrong"
positive,"Hi there. Had this App for several years now.The App appearance and ""look"" has changed recently and since this has happened, the App will not open on my Android phone. I have removed and re-installed several times but still will not open. Dissapointing as I work in Care/Sports Training field and often am required to ring 000 to get assistance for injured sports people. Hope it works before my local AFL pre-season starts again in late November. Please, please get it fixed."
neutral,This App does not work!
neutral,I am using Android 7 and it doesn't work for me following the update to PLUS.
negative,Used to work fine but after latest update it won't open at all. I've deleted and reinstalled it to no avail.
negative,Latest update broken. Will not start on my Android Samsung phone crashes immediately. How do i vwt the working version baxk again?
positive,Updated the app now it does not work. Uninstalled. What a joke. This app is like everything else in South Australia ..... Broken.
positive,Have had the original app for a long time. Since the upgrade it will not open.
positive,"It was working perfectly and I had recommended it to all my friends. But since the update, its hopeless. This used to be the best app around. Now its awful"
negative,Setting the font size bigger doesn't fit in the space provided. Should have kept previous icon.
neutral,Doesn't work since update. Uninstalling now
neutral,"New Update App is crashing will not open on my Android 6 Marshmallow Phone, but works fine on latest Galaxy Tab +S7 with Android 10. Poor oversight, do you guys test these BEFORE you release?, Now I have No Emergency App on Phone...great work."
positive,The updated App. says it's stopped. So now it doesn't work. Never had any problems with the previous app. Please reinstate
neutral,Will not open.
negative,"App will not open, keeps closing. I've Uninstaller n reinstalled a number of times without success"
neutral,Won't work
negative,"Never had a problem with the old app, but the latest one won't open. Have uninstalled, reinstalled and cleared cache to no avail."
negative,This app does not want to open. Can't download. Android
positive,Can't open the app which immediately closes down. Can you please help me to fix the problem
neutral,since last update doesn't work with j7 galaxy
negative,Most pathetic excuse for an app. Supposed to be an emergency app. Thought you knew what you were doing. Obviously you have no idea.
negative,Just down loaded the app and have noticed the app has my current location in my neighbours house (I'm actually sitting in my own lounge room) and the 3 important words that I would have to use in case of an emergency are partial covered by other information on the screen.
positive,You would think if they were going to relaunch this app they would make sure it didn't keep crashing when trying to open.
neutral,Crashes immediately.
negative,Won't work on Samsung s7 . Constantly says stopped. Not sure if linked but I do have the covid app constantly running
positive,Looks good with the upgrade
positive,Great app
negative,Will not open on my Samsung Android? It keeps showing as closing. I have deleted it and resubmitted but still no go.
positive,Doesn't open. Disappointing
positive,"Great concept of the 3 words location, and has all of the important emergency numbers and instructions"
neutral,Does not open
positive,Was good. Now crashes
negative,"It's showing the wrong ðŸ  house, we're nextdoor"
positive,Won't open. App stopped
neutral,Crashes on startup since last update
positive,It's a great idea I have samsung 9 the app was working but suddenly stopped and i have tried closing app reloading app and turning phone off and restarting it.
positive,This a great App. The App has stopped working. With last update. Iam using a samsung A5.
positive,"All very good and have had it since original version. However with the intro of What3Words the font needs to be bigger so it is more visible, especially for those that have some vision impairment . Or have the functionality to change the W3W font like the Long/Lat."
negative,I too have problems 'this app doesn't work anymore'. Tried in the bush today. Unsuccessful. Bit of a worry. Helen Aiton
negative,Change the original icon back!! Haven't used the app yet but the new icon will confuse people in distressing situations.
negative,Has now stopped working on my Galaxy running Android 8. Very disappointing
negative,Done update now it won't open What have you done ðŸ˜­ To bad if i have to use it
positive,Keeps saying app keeps stopping. Earlier version worked perfectly.
positive,Could have saved my life but doesn't work anymore
positive,"It replaced the previous triple 000 app which is perfectly works. This is not working at all. It says, the app has stopped. Please, before changing the any emergency app make sure and make sure it works perfectly. It will not be a emergency app if doesn't works."
positive,After an automatic update it no longer works on my Samsung Galaxy 5. Please ensure the current version is backwardly compatible. Lives depend on its functionality.
neutral,Not working since last update
negative,I can't open it at all since the very recent update. Not impressed!!!
neutral,The updated version of this app won't open on my mobile.
negative,Have uninstalled and reinstalled the app since the update but it still doesn't work like it did prior to the update. Disappointing
positive,"A great app but for some reason it stopped working on my phone. Everytime I open it, it immediately crashes."
negative,Has stopped working reinstalled and still not working
negative,Since you have updated the app fails to work. This meant to be an emergency app that was working perfectly before you updated it. Please repair ASAP so it can be used in an emergency
negative,Why is this app no working anymore? It keeps crashing after the latest update
neutral,"App won't open anymore... Reinstalled, still won't open."
negative,This shows an incorrect address for my home. But no way to correct or advise! Dangerous.
positive,This New version is not working on my Samsung Galaxy. I have checked settings all seems ok
positive,Was a great app until you updated it now it wont even open
positive,"Great app if you can open it, constantly shuts down"
negative,Latest version doesn't want to open on an older Android 7 based phone...stops almost immediately. Might be the same problem that the updated BoM app had for a while...
positive,Have recently uninstalled app as it not working anymore. It won't ever load. Was great when it was working
neutral,Will not even load since the latest update
neutral,Since updating not working
neutral,Ess we weer w we re w e et wees dw ess e wed er we see we f wwest
negative,"I have installed and reinstalled this app but it still won't open. Or "" Emergency + app has stopped"". Please fix this! It's an Emergency app. The previous one worked just fine. My phone :Samsungalaxy Note 5"
negative,New icon but it doesn't work any more. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but it continues to say it has stopped working. Who can fix this?
positive,Great tool especially if you find yourself on a long stretch of road or in the bush and need to know where you are to call for help.
positive,Show the best
neutral,3effe
negative,"It might get 5 stars if you would explain where my three words comes into the picture. No obvious reference to it when you open the app, just normal coordinates"
positive,"5 stars as very simple, functional and essential. Map could be improved by letting you drop a pin to get another location - some emergencies might need that information (like where you were five mins ago, or where someone else is)."
negative,I just downloaded this app opened it to see I was some 5 klms from where I am. Not much help if I have an emergency in a rural area. I have just uninstalled it.
positive,"Brilliant idea, I learnt about this app while doing the online criteria for my first aid certificate renewal and having needed to cal 000 before and not known the address of my location I think this is amazing and should be more widely known!"
positive,"Surely this sort of app would allow you to save personal information to be shared with emergency services (only if you need to contact them): allergies, medications, doctor, next of kin, home address, blood type, need glasses, wear contacts."
neutral,Does this app work for the US?? Reading things.. To my knowledge we do not use the (000)
neutral,Need to fix NRS access
positive,Great app if you dont have phone service.
positive,"Not that I have used the App yet, not that I hope to use it either, but being a TC my company has recommended all staff to have access to it in case it is needed. In reading previous comments about the size of the GPS Co - Ords #'s, and being to small to read with out glasses access, I have found that if you tap the Red box the Address & Co-Ords are written in it does Enlarge the Text. When I discovered this the numbers went from illegible to legible without my glasses on."
positive,Use the app to find various location. Works extremely well and really accurate.
positive,It's basic but that's perfect
positive,Live this app very helpful when in emergencies
positive,Easy to use and accurate.
positive,GPS coordinates can take precious time to read out and are prone to miscommunication. What3words may be better in some circumstances.
positive,Excellent
neutral,Content âœŒï¸âœŒï¸âœŒï¸âœŒï¸
positive,Awesome
positive,"Neil's comment (20th April 2020) is 100% correct. I have the app and give it 5 stars... but... a newer app does so MUCH MORE!!! Check out 'What3Words'. It has so many more uses and is used by millions of people since it was launched in 2013. ie; Locating friends in crowds at a football match or rock concert (not much use right now but will be when COV-19 is under control), quickly finding a business in large industrial complexes; finding a friend's camping spot off the beaten track. Sure, you can use GPS co-ordinates, but three words are so much easier to enter and remember than a string of numbers.Try it."
positive,"Would like to see integration of the what3words location protocol, for the stressed, elderly or vision impaired reading out the lat & long is a big ask."
neutral,LIFE SAVER IN EMERGENCYS.
positive,It's good to call emergency people
positive,I like the idea of this app but the location coordinates are very rarely accurate so it doesn't really serve its purpose for me.
positive,Easy and simple to use.
positive,"Excellent service, app great resource."
positive,"Excellent - but needs one tweak. This app should be preloaded on every Aussie mobile device, for its ability to quickly provide an accurate location to emergency services. However, it would be much improved for rural and highway use by adding an approximate distance and bearing from the nearest town, as the lat/long may be too complex and the highway name and 'suburb' not specific enough for some users and/or agencies."
positive,"Excellent, Didn't have to used so far during Bushfire"
negative,When address show up while I am at home the app shows the wrong address and as such emergency vehicles would not find me - my home address 5 Demijohn crt Huntly address show on the app 6 Lakeview crt Huntly Vic - Lat -36.67637 Long 144.33854
positive,"Perfect app for its purpose: something to contact help in the event of an emergency. No frills; it opens up quickly and silently every single time, and provides location data as soon as possible, including GPS coordinates and address. Important contacts are listed clearly, there are no little buttons or menus to mess around with. The design of the app is clean and simple. The designers of this app understand what needs it must fulfill. A must have, in case of emergencies."
positive,Benefits (my safety) outways the long terms and conditions that you need to agree too I hope.
positive,"While a good idea, I can see room for improvement. e.g. Imagine the situation where a caller can't read the screen (too young, lost eyeglasses, degraded vision, etc). An option for the app to speak would be good. To say your location out loud, to speak CPR instructions if you have no reception to call 000, etc"
neutral,Everyone should have this app on their mobiles. You never know when you'll need it.
neutral,Hundred percent nessesary
positive,Great app easy to use
positive,Good
positive,Really handy for helping your self and I'm in cadets so it's really useful if you see some one who is injured
positive,"A must have free ""000 location"" app within Australia for all."
positive,Has all the emergency services and is easy to locate them in the app. Hope I don't have to use it.
negative,Good idea but very bad app. Locks up the phone and then had a system ui crash
positive,"Great start but plenty of room for functional improvement as demonstrared in various other reviews. Be aware that if your 'location' function is turnred off this app will not over ride and turn it on. This would be an important upgrade, as would-be making the app accessible without the need to login. Also, a button is used to call 000 in one touch. It's accompanied by several other buttons. Perhaps it would be faster if 3 buttons were available for 000. This should expedite the call."
neutral,Everyone needs to download this
neutral,The address is incorrect how can I fix it
neutral,How about some numbers for specialist mental health services and animal emergencies?
negative,Terrible terrible terms of use.
neutral,Works exactly as described.
neutral,Only usefull if u have Data on ur phone and a phone signal. I live in Australia and beleave me there are plenty of places where u cant get a phone signal. This will never work in outback australia.
neutral,At the moment I've had none
positive,I like the GPS feature
positive,Great simple to use app that transmits basic information. Would be great if you could add essential health data or something like that if required.
positive,Good
positive,Could you please add a CPR resuscitation box. Thanks..
positive,The Best App
positive,Invaluable. Thank you.
negative,"I would like to use this app but I cannot agree to the licence agreement which includes an onerous indemnification clause. Licence says ""You indemnify FRNSW against all liability, loss, damage or injury suffered by any person, organisation, or entity in connection with the use of Content or the Licensed Application"" This means that if FRNSW has to pay compensation to ANYONE after they have used this app that I will foot the bill!"
positive,Brilliant App. Thank you for inventing this one.
positive,Good app. Handy if you don't know exactly where you are. Suggestion though: please increase the font size on the location coordinates and address. It's impossible for me to read them without my glasses. :-)
positive,Nothing to say as I just open this app - I hope I don't need to use it however I hope I will be happy with it when necessary ðŸ‘Œ thanks
positive,Contact emergency services reliably easily sharing your location
positive,"Outstanding app, so helpful when it comes to calling for emergency help"
positive,Great
positive,IT SEEMS CAPABLE OF FINDING YOU WITHING A METRE. YOU WILL HAVE HELP SO FAST THANKS GUYS I FEEL SAFER AFTER HAVING HEART ATTACKS AND SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. XO THANKYOU.
positive,Great app for elderly people
positive,"Done My First Aid Course An My Instructor Chris Has Showed The Class This App An So We All Are So Happy With The Info An Life Saving Options It Has, An You Dont Even Need Internet Data To Access Its Good Deeds"
neutral,Must have app if you live in Australia!
positive,Paul Dillon said its good so therefore its good
positive,Love it
neutral,Had to use this app interface works spot on
negative,"PUBLIC AND FRNSW PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS.Whoever is in responsible for public awareness of this app SHOULD BE SACKED. Less than 2 days ago there was a father and daughter lost in deep snow near Thredbo. This opportunity, and many others in the past, must be seized upon and the media used to educate and reinforce the need for all persons to have this app on their phone and to know how to use it. I have used app before, as a Police Radio Dispatcher. 5 teenage girls were lost in bushland in winter at night. Police had been searching for them for some time but the girls didn't know where they were and a triangulation from there phone only showed a rough area. The supervisor was about to call in a helicopter to assist in the search. I called back the young girl's phone and asked if she had the Emergency+ app on her phone. She didn't but she did have internet connection so I was able to talk her through the download. Within minutes I had her location PINPOINTED through the lat/long coordinates. Using mapping we were able to walk the girls to a close by track whilst coordinating Police to walk in from the nearest road. This is just one of many stories about this app. IT SAVES LIVES!!"
neutral,My hubby needs this app for work but cant seem to find it on his phone but got it on mine. We are old skool. His is a S4 and im a S5.
positive,Great App everyone should hav ere it on their phone
negative,Not very useful. it needs to contain basic CPR details. Perhaps even a beeping sound to synchronise your chest compressions
positive,Would be even better if it automatically sent location
positive,This app is basicly needed on all phones. great tracking and shown phone numbers for any emergency.
positive,Brilliant app just hope i don't have to use it
negative,tried to call 000 with it hangs up straight away not a good app
negative,great APP but haven't tested it out yet in the bush were there is no phone reception they say it will still work who knows..
positive,Great app to save livws in the elderly especially..
positive,Great! Makes me feel safer.
negative,"This app is useless. I live in regional Victoria & the address it is showing is not where I am. It is showing the same town, but not exactly where I am. How am I meant to use it if it can't even show me the correct details??"
negative,not helpful your phone give you all this info already I downloaded it then delete it
negative,Needs text for those with breathing difficulties.
positive,COOL
negative,"not good, has very limited features, use google instead"
neutral,awsome
negative,"The app displays location coordinates, but so does any gps app. It still requires the user to be able to read out the numbers. The poor accuracy reported by some users is probably the inevitable result of using it indoors."
negative,when you ring the emergency service your location disappears How can you tell them your location. Useless untill fixed In an emergency you more than likely will only have enough time to dial the emergency number shown on the app Not a great time to be trying to access the app showing location when you are in a call
positive,great app
negative,i has everything i need in an emergency
neutral,An essential app. Just in case
positive,great program
positive,please allow copy paste of latitude and longitude
positive,what a fantastic app to have in case you need someone. I can be anywhere in the house and collapse with my condition and no one will ever know. I keep my phone close to my wheelchair in a pocket my Wife made for me and it gives me a little peace of mind that this app is available without much effort. I think that is the most important thing a app you can push without to much effort for Emergency situations!
positive,everyone should download this app it's excellent
neutral,Every mobile phone should have this app. Just in case!!!
neutral,posted
positive,easy to use and a great tool
negative,"needs a mental health call line, other than that its an easy to use app, gives you your exact coodinates and your address if available, plus numbers for services like SES, police help line and all that similar stuff, but a suicide hotline is thr only thing missing and its a pretty major need"
positive,fits my needs perfectly
positive,Would be better if you could add additional information like medication used and who to contact incase of emergency also if this app can be accessed while phone is locked.
neutral,This App should be on everyone's phone.
negative,This app is useless because the coordinates are wrong up to 5km out which is no good for emergency services. When I ring the ambulance service they pin point my location immediately.
positive,great
negative,having no phone reception this app was great to have but IT DISPLAYS WRONG NUMBER ON LOCATION. this makes this app useless to me and there are no options of MANUALLY INPUT FOR EXACT ADDRESS. This feature is totally necessary for this application.
positive,best app for emergencies. 10 out of 10.
positive,"When I installed the app on opening it, it had a box with "" I AGREE"" , but nothing saying what i agree to! Would be like writing a blank cheque."
positive,Seems a good app. Only issue is that it doesn't show GPS coordinates.
negative,"What a great idea. I personally never know where the hell I am, to have the exact street name and number available is so simple it's gold. thankyou!"
positive,great app but does not give major cross Street which is first question 000 ask
positive,excellent accuracy
positive,how could this app be usefull when GPS has my location 5 klm away. thats not good. would be useful if i can put my own address in the location too.
positive,This app was extremely useful in a breakdown on the M1 to describe our exact location
positive,install and hope you never have to use it.
negative,"it's a piece of mind to have gps coordinates in case of emergency while camping. not sure if its possible, but I think this app could me more valuable if you were able to access it from a locked phone and therefore if something was to happen to me, my family or friends would have access to it. also maybe if it could be linked to rural fire service for fire danger announcements and fire danger ratings"
neutral,n..lm i22 mb
positive,"1/5 stars, not because it doesn't work, but because it needs Google play services... Seriously!?!"
positive,Great app for emergencies!
negative,"Location accuracy is the problem of the network, not the app as i discovered when on phone to police they tried to tell me i was in West Swan about 4 ks from my actual location. Got off the phone and went straight to google maps and still 3 streets away from my actual location. Who do you blame, the carrier, the app maker or just our network. GPS coordinates may also be wrong if the map is wrong"
positive,"This app was recommended to me by a friend. Hopefully I never have to use it, but if I do, it looks like it will be incredibly beneficial. Thank you."
positive,"Great app. Suggestions: a share button next to your coordinates. A duress alarm. An internet based call lodgment, often I have internet and/or sms ability when I can't make a call."
positive,"It needs a more modern look and needs a more advanced system such as having an ambulance see your location automatically, along with other stuff."
neutral,Does this work in Western Australia?
positive,Great app but needs setting to be shown on lock screen.
positive,I absolutely love this app. Super helpful and effective
positive,Quick and easy however it would be good if there was a way to copy your gps coords and address to clipboard so they can be sent as a txt to someone. If you are in an area with poor reception you can sometimes send a txt even if calls are not able to be made.
neutral,Is there a way of putting in our correct address? Mine is showin in units behind me. Not even in correct street.
positive,"This app seems great. The fact it has numbers for other help such as crime stoppers and poison hotline and the line for people who are deaf or speech impaired is fantastic. The only thing I would suggest is a line such as access line, or beyondblue as such lines have proved very life saving for my family including getting someone into the ambulance at a critical time. I have one question that for obvious reasons I don't want to try but the numbers attached in this app do they register and begin a phone call when pressed?"
positive,Hope I never need it. Well done. A nice-to-have might be a CPR metronome.
positive,Looks good. Haven't needed to use it yet but keep it on starting screen just in case.
positive,Really impressed by the news that a bushwalking grand father got saved from a deadly snakebite . Downloaded the app and found that it's the simplest intelligent app I had everseen simple and straight forward.. the app is enabled with geotagging...
positive,Great app
positive,"I think it would be more useful if additional buttons could be added by the user. For example wildlide rescue, nrma etc as having location coordinates at these times may also assist."
negative,"Emergency+ is ok but could do more - could have an In Emergency mode, auto 
send SMS with name, location to 106, etc."
neutral,Everyone should have this app My by
positive,"This app put my work location on the road behind it and on a hill. At home 
is says I'm at my neighbours, there's a fair gasp between us"
positive,Very very good
positive,Needs lifeline number. Otherwise great
negative,"So the one main use of this app is its GPS locator, which tried to convince 
me it had received a signal accurate to six metres, six seconds ago, while 
I was at a location two full houses away from there. This is dangerously 
misleading and bad coding considering the actual embedded Google map was 
showing my correct location but your app's terrible API was completely 
failing to translate it into an accurate reading."
positive,"Not relevant to Victoria. Once the GPS locates you in Victoria it still 
calls the NSW police number. Also, in Victoria we call 000 for SES 
emergencies such as road rescue, or rope rescue, not the other number the 
app automatically calls. Unsure about the need for this app other than to 
show your location, which Google maps does?"
negative,"The only problem with this app is there is no button to use for silent 
assistance. I've needed assistance before but couldn't talk as my abuser 
was right there beside me. There should be an option for someone to use in 
a similar situation."
negative,"Had to remove this app as it was sending random emergency messages and 
distressing my family. IT STILL SENDS EMERGENCY MESSAGES even though app 
has been removed! I have restarted phone etc and it is still doing it. This 
is very distressing for my family and needs to be fixed immediately!"
positive,"Just used for the first time was able to accurately inform police of the 
location I was calling from. I forgot you can open the app and call 
directly from it. Definitely keeping this one."
positive,Very useful App.
positive,"This is great so useful for my work and everyday life. Im trying to find 
one that provided the location of a AED nearby in NSW i have found plenty 
for everywhere else. Maybe it can be added to this app that wouod be useful."
neutral,A life saving app
positive,"Your app just sent me a ""thank you for using the app"" message at 6:30 AM. I didn't appreciate that at all.  Thanks for the quick response. Yours is the only emergency app I have on my phone. As far as the app goes it is very good.  I cannot find the records of the incoming message on my phone. I received a second one around 9am. If I get another I will try to check its provenance. John"
positive,"Good app, needs to have 112 dialer for australian mobile. Then it would be a great app"
positive,"App is clear and easy to use. I have it installed with widget on my home page. Can you tell me how to get it onto my Lock Screen, where I just have an ICE contact message.  I use a Nexus6P phone."
negative,"Cancel button is ignored/ has no effect if Location is disabled or Airplane mode is enabled. Of course for the app to work both of these must be set correctly, but still it's a bug if just testing the app."
positive,Fantastic app. May save lives. Everyone should have it.
positive,"Luckily, I've never needed to use this but it should have a widget."
negative,Great concept. But I live in a regional area and found GPS suburb and address dramatically wrong. No ability to enter correct details. No ability to type landmarks. Useless to me in an emergency.
neutral,Simply essential...
positive,Great idea but lacks silent reporting! For example when a person is in danger and can't talk for personal safety reasons. I would be happy with registration system which could identify me and my location on a button click.
positive,"Would be great if it got the location right, such an important app need high accuracy needs,more work and would be fantastic"
negative,"I've installed this app twice, three years apart, and both times uninstalled it again as soon as I look at where it says I am. The gps positioning is fairly accurate, but the street address it converts that to is wrong. There are 3 vacant blocks between me and the next house, and the street number it gives is the middle one of the three. Sorry, Emergency+, but that's just not good enough. I want police to come straight to my door, not to think the fracas was on vacant land and must have resolved itself because there's no-one there now."
positive,Unable to start the app... I will keep sending reports untill hopefully there will be an update.
positive,Good
negative,Ok. Add the fire service or an option to add local hospital or doctors number.
negative,Ass
negative,"The app cannot identify my location, makes it fairly useless."
positive,"Good concept. Would be good if you could quickly share your location via one of your installed messaging apps e.g. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS rather than having to read these small numbers out with a chance of error I would assume. You could then send the coordinates to a friend and you could even have pre-written messages with low, medium, urgent and life threatening levels telling them to pass it onto another authority. Basically you could get that message to someone in seconds rather than making an error prone phone call. Also messaging can sometimes get through where phone calls will not. It should also send your phone number in the message so you can be reached."
negative,Great idea. But entry to our property is on a completley different road. Google maps give us the correct address. Why cant this. Its says our entry is almost 700metres up the road. As a emergency worker in a bad situation this could be difficult getting to someone quickly.
positive,Being a mobile app it would be better to use 112 then 000 ? My understanding is 000 uses your own mobile carrier where 112 uses the strongest carrier signal regardless of who your carrier is!
neutral,"Needs to have lock screen access, otherwise whats the point?"
positive,"Great concept. Keep developing though. Needs a refresh button for My Location; sometimes this is highly accurate, other times it is showing where I was an hour ago. Add other features like In Case of Emergency (ICE) call ... . What details the 000 operator needs (e.g. nearest cross-street). Etc. Then more people will download it."
positive,I work in helicopter emergency services. It would also be very useful if the app also had the position in degrees and minutes or degrees minutes seconds
positive,Awesome
negative,This app is dangerous. It gives the wrong address. Do not rely on location data. I am in a queensland city and it gives completely the wrong street.
negative,Needs SMS Alert button for Emergency Contact with GPS positioning attached.
negative,I don't like the way it does an estimated location up to 3.5 km. That is still a massive area to cover if it is housing or bushland or even ocean!
positive,Great app. Would have come in very handy in a recent incident I experienced where I had to call emergency while in shock and I had lost my reading glasses in the incident. The only suggestion I'd make is for the address and GPS coordinates to be a bit bigger to make them easier to read without glasses for those of us who need them.
positive,"This is a fantastic app. However, since the last update it no longer shows the actual address"
positive,Greatest idea! Love this app
negative,"Great App. Worked well on my HTC, however since changing to Samsung Galaxy S5, the physical address is no longer visible. Co-ordinates are still visible, but difficult to remember in an emergency event. Still shows as updating address."
positive,Fantastic app!!! Highly recommend downloading. It would be great though if it also gave you the nearest cross street to the location as this is a common question the emergency operators ask.
negative,No longer showing physical address which is disappointing.
negative,"Just installed it and my location address popped up as being 12 houses away, not much confidence in life threatening situations being felt..."
positive,"Great app for emergency. Gives your location and has hot button for ""triple zero"" & SES"
positive,We've had two emergencies since downloading this app. It is fabulous to not scramble for the police info line or a location. This is a must have app for all. Works perfectly.
positive,Great
neutral,A must have app for all
negative,It would be nice to add the national poisons hotline number.
positive,Awesome
positive,Great app. Would that bit better if the information was further refined based on the state you are located in
positive,Good to have.
negative,Handy app to have when travlling if you need to give address details to emergency serves
positive,App crashes on first use. Looks like it's a race condition with asking for location permission. App could probably be used smarter with the dispatcher systems to give better information to operators quicker
neutral,If i could rate a zero i would
neutral,Keeps crashing all the time
positive,Cant get it to load up. Crashes every single time. Wish is would work. My phone is a samung galaxy 6 edge on Nuget OS.
positive,Great idea for an app I hope to never need. Ine feature that would be cool would be to have a function that silently alerts emergency services as to your location when it would be unsafe for the caller to talk in certain circumstances (like being held as a hostage or when talking would alert the aggressor).
positive,App Crashes when you try and make a call. Great concept but needs better execution
positive,The app maybe good but i think that would be about it.
negative,"Bit worrisome that this app crashes as soon as it is launched. (Samsung Galaxy S7, Nougat 7.0, telstra network)"
positive,Great idea but needs to have ability to have one click to turn on location services. I downloaded to help my young kids but they can't read the instructions to turn that functionality ok.
negative,Disappointed that it won't work on my phone I keep getting an error message. It would be a fantastic app to have in an emergency if it worked
neutral,Didn't open !
negative,Good but there are other apps out there (not aussie unfortunately) that do the same but include emergency medical information. Sos messaging to emergency contacts with gps position. Seach for local medical facilitys. All this in the one app for arround $2. If this app did all that i would use it.
positive,Would be great if it worked
positive,"I cant open the app. As soon as i try to open this app a message pops ups saying ""screen overlay detected. Please turn off in settings&gt;apps"" i tryed to turn off screen overlay, however my phone has no setting to turn ""screen overlay"" off. Please fix"
neutral,Every age needs it
negative,"App provides GPS coordinates but no address details. No street name or nearest cross street, just ""Lake Macquarie"" which is a huge area."
positive,Great idea
positive,Fantastic concept especially if you have young kids. Recommend it for everyone
negative,Unfortunately the app won't open. Just keeps saying the usual android phrase. Unfortunately emergency + has stopped working.
positive,Great
positive,Great application.         Recommend it at every warden training session. Should be a standard on all new phones in place of most of the crap pre-installed. Great that Poisons info & National Crime numbers now added. Spot on guys!
positive,A must have app for everyone. I love it and wouldn't be without it.
neutral,The google map is working again...great
positive,Highly recommended to everyone.
positive,All emergency services at your fingertips. Excellent
negative,"App is unstable. Stopped on install and then intermittently throughout setup - tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but continued to happen. Shoes GPS coordinates but no Google map."
positive,Very good app and although I have never had to use it it's a great thing to have in case of an Emergency.
negative,"A completely useless app that was just a waste of storage on my phone. I can't imagine how much it must have cost to make this app but however much it was, it was a complete waste of money. Surely the government can find better things to fund rather than an app with a big button to ""call 000 in an emergency."" Kindergarten kids are taught the number so I fail to see the point in creating an app to tell their parents what to dial in an emergency..."
positive,As a emergency service worker I find this app great it gives me my GPS cords and that's really important
neutral,Indispensable
positive,I installed this app expecting never to need to use it in the city areas but I was injured on a street I didn't know and I was able to give the 000 operator the address and longitude and latitude numbers and they found me. So happy this app exists.
negative,"Updated and map now blank. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting phone ... but still no map."
positive,Best app of all and most important one
neutral,Firefighter
negative,"App works EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, if you take the time to read the t's&c's you'll notice the disclaimer on exact positioning. You'll probably also notice that same disclaimer on anything that provides a gps location, as there are many different variables that affect that tech, for example, solar flares completely fk it up. For anyone saying the address isn't perfect, you wont get the ambos directly there anyway, in any case you send someone out to the road to direct them. Use your common sense people."
negative,"This app will get ambulance, police & fire services to the scene of an emergency without delay."
positive,A fantastic tool to give you all the details you need in an emergency when you're own head might be all mixed up.
positive,Google location is too inaccurate for use. Otherwise good app.
positive,I would like to see a section we could add our meds alliges and next of kin phone numbers
negative,"Had to use this app today. Couldn't find street signs and Google maps was too slow, so gave location to operator using latitude and longitude from Emergency+. Worked very well."
neutral,Not accurate
positive,Easy to see & use
neutral,As seen on tv
positive,My address shown on the app always matches the current address I am at. Very useful and I use this app on both ios and Android devices.
positive,Great idea. Suggest update in order to make available from lock screen. Then 5 stars
negative,First- if you are reading all the bad reviews about the gps location- that is because of the device NOT THE APP!!! Great innovation and its only going to get better!!!
negative,"Those who complain about the GPS locations being wrong you obviously didn't read the Terms and conditions regarding the application. '(iii) the availability and accuracy of GPS information is subject to limitations arising due to availability of signals, the relevant mobile device, location and geography' Stop balling the developers."
negative,"It's way off on my address, so if something happens while I'm at home I'll ring and say ""these are the gps coordinates, but they are wrong, hopefully you'll find me before it's too late"". Please fix as the gps should be dead right, not telling me I live at my neighbours over the back fence or in the street beside me. Hate for something to happen and emergency services break down someone elses door.."
negative,Sadly it doesn't work with my Ideos running Android 2.2. Emergency button app does but it does not have the phone number or web address to send address or GPS data to.
positive,Thanks
positive,"Location is off. Would be good if you could reposition it on the map, to make it more accurate, when needed."
positive,"Excellent, all the information you need in one place."
negative,Gave the wrong address straight away and wouldn't let me change it
negative,In case of accident app shows your GPS coordinates and all emergency phone numbers. In a Emergency the time you save could be the difference between life and death
positive,This has helped me respond really well to medical emergencies
positive,A welcome initiative.
positive,My dad was the main person to make this and drive it forward. He had the vision to help others. This means that rescue time is cut down and your chance of survival increases
negative,Travelling in caravan and used when drugged person tried entering van and did adjoining van. Was able to provide detailed info for area to local police to assist in location and apprehension of villian
negative,After installing I noticed my battery dropping 5% overnight for no apparent reasons. After uninstalling this my battery usage went back to normal.
positive,Great app. I also think another useful contact to include would be poison information. Hope I never have to use it!
positive,Uninstalled when it wanted me to agree to a wall of text that would take hours to read and a law degree to understand
neutral,Tell dispatch the longitude and latitude coordinates of your position NOT your location as it will not be 100% accurate
positive,Helpful
positive,Lifesaver
neutral,Teacher
neutral,Has me living in a street off my actual street which doesnt exist. How does that even happen?
positive,Looks like a great app however iam in a new estate and maps not the latest. Sent email hopefully fixed soon.
neutral,For Australia
negative,Emergency
neutral,What you should have
neutral,I was able to quickly get an ambulance and tell them exactly where to come.. This app helped someone this week.
positive,"Definitely worth having, but needs some refinement. NSW 000 dispatchers were unable to get an Ambulance directly to an off-road location in Sydney Olympic Park in Jan 2016.. The dispatcher reported their maps do not show the off-road walkways and cycle paths that are clearly available on the app, and googlemaps and openstreetmaps. Or did he transcribe the coordinates incorrectly ? It appeared the dispatcher was not looking at the same map as we could see on the app. It would vastly improve communication if the application were able to upload the coordinates to the 000 dispatchers via an internet or SMS link. It would also be a very useful extension if the application could share the coordinates via SMS or internet links to Council or National Park Rangers etc.,. who may need to unlock gates for ambulance and police to reach incident sites."
positive,Great app
negative,"Brings up correct position on map but lists the wrong adress. States im 10 houses away, around the corner and opposite side of the road! Im a rescue volunteer, these errors cost time and lives!"
positive,As a SES member I find it useful most of the time
negative,"It's a strange concept to download a app hoping to never need it, good on you developers for making this app"
positive,Very useful with all relevant information.
negative,Putty Rd is notorious for 2 things. Limited phone coverage and motorcycle accidents. This app helped to save a mates life last weekend
negative,Great app but will not give my correct address how can I change my house number and unit number these are new unit block 10 months old.
neutral,Wont download on my Samsung galaxy core?
positive,Awesome idea for an app. Very easy to use in emergency situations and non emergencys alike.
positive,had the care flight chopper land on our farm west of kingaroy... this app allowed the aircrew to find our property with pinpoint accuracy!
positive,"I've used this app in the bush with a single car roll-over and three young people, one heavily pregnant. Coordinates are the best way to direct help to any location! Thank you!"
neutral,Wildly swinging between 2 street names and numbers also the current name of street has been changed about 4 yrs ago Im in a c v park
positive,Excellent App credit to NSW Services
positive,"Used it a few times now, the only thing id like to see is the address your at displayed, while on the call to 000"
positive,Very useful
positive,Throughly love and always recommend... Hope I never need to use it yet its there just in case... ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘ðŸ’“ðŸ’•ðŸ’žðŸ’ðŸ’–ðŸ’™
negative,When I tried to install it came up with failed error 194 not much help if I don't know what that is
positive,Safety
positive,"This app has Police, Fire, Ambulance and SES. One thing that would be good to include, is Rescue. I am a NSW Rescue Operator and for people to have the option to contact Rescue, we could be responded a lot faster and have reliable details and locations provided by the app. Just a suggestion. Otherwise terrific app!"
positive,Very pleased to find this available
positive,I like this app. Soo helpful
positive,I love this as a concept but at home it lists my location as across the road and 5 houses down! Would still be useful for outdoor / road based emergencies though.
positive,Sounds like a great idea
neutral,Don't want to have to use it but this is an app that should be on all mobiles when you start them up. As a person who does long drives this is a must.
neutral,This is a much needed application when you have a family member with a serious illness. Thanks
positive,Brilliant. Takes the guess work out of trying to find out what the closest cross street is or where you actually are.
positive,I read about the app in the Take 5 magazine and downloaded it straight away. I have also told my daughters 20 & 18 to download it as well
neutral,0
negative,"Address was close, but wrong (only has to be out by one house number, to end badly!). Given the serious nature of this app, close enough, isn't good enough- people's lives are at stake! If Google earth can get my address right, surely this app should be able to, as well!"
negative,"On an Xiaomi Redmi Note 1S, and on some other phones which are imported, Emergency+ isn't able to translate the GPS coordinates into a street address. The GPS coordinates are fast and accurate (within 10m or so), but the address part of the front screen is not filled in. Perhaps there is some API call that is required for it to work that is not available? On the map screen, it continues to say ""(Address updated x seconds ago)"", but only displays the latitude and long coordiates."
positive,Great
neutral,Doesn't work on my galaxy S3
positive,Wonderful
positive,It's a matter of life and death when it comes to locating your exact location. This is a great creation for Everyone to install And Most of All it Gives Emergency services your Exact location without Delay or Confusion. Well Done To Emergency Services.
positive,Great app
positive,Long overdue. Excellent app
positive,"Brilliant idea, especially when travelling through unfamiliar places!"
positive,Very important for children's phones
negative,If I ever got lost its reassuring to know that I could be found by emergency services.
positive,Incorrect house number
neutral,Everyone should have this APP
positive,Very helpful but my address is not correct
neutral,A very handy app everyone should have
positive,"I've been getting Seniors & Grey Nomads to add this essential app to their phones for 18 months now. It's so simple for anyone to use. In my view every phone in Australia should have this preloaded, along with the Red Cross app and, in Victoria, the Fire Ready app."
neutral,For emergencies only
positive,Love it
positive,I think this is a brilliant app & have told all my family & friends to use it.
positive,This is extremely valuable. Good job
positive,I encourage as a St Johns Ambulance volunteer that everyone install this
neutral,Cannot use. Crashed upon opening
positive,Always have help at hand.
positive,Sounds promising but I hope I never need to use it. I am concerned and need to know why it requests access to my photos. Why?
positive,A great app will help out a lot in an emergency. My only concern is you can't get an address if your mobile data is off. GPS coordinate still work but if an address would be more useful
negative,Is it possible to add the Poison Information Helpline (13 11 26) in the list?
neutral,I always think that if I saw something I probably wouldn't really know where I am
negative,Location that comes up is about 35 km from our actual location. Useless!
negative,Emergency[
positive,Great app
neutral,For emergencies.
neutral,A must for everyone to have on their phone just in case!!!
positive,"All P platers, or kids who walk or ride to school, should have this app in their smart phone"
neutral,What is the Photos/Media/Files permission used for?
negative,google maps has my home address wrong
positive,Makes good sense.
negative,Emergency+ app
positive,This app is something I would have thought someone would have made years ago. It's such a brilliant idea
positive,"When needing help in serious situation, best App available"
positive,Great tool thank you
positive,The best way to be found if you need to be found when you are geographicly incapasitated
positive,Good
positive,Great idea!!!
positive,"This app does exactly what it's meant to. A must install for everyone... who knows, it may even save a life!"
negative,"Everyone should have this, but developers are unresponsive. Badly needs two improvements: 1. The GPS coordinates and address need to be in a larger font so those with aging eyesight can read it. 2. Should be able to SMS GPS coordinates and address to my own emergency contacts. Reason is simple: poor signal sometimes prevents voice calls but SMS gets through."
negative,"I am in my home and it had wrong street number, out by 6 houses."
neutral,When I'm at the back of my house it picks my neighbour behind me address
neutral,Gives Emergency Services the details they need to find you if it becomes necessary - hopefully it never does
negative,Simple and effective but has not try it in an emergency
neutral,Gps turns off when exiting the app now
positive,Works great on various phones in family but cannot install on new Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet which has GPS and full phone capability via installed SIM card.
negative,Using lot numbers not street number. Very confusing. Also needs ability to send info to your own personal emergency contacts.
positive,"Excellent app, should be installed on all mobiles!"
positive,"This simple yet potentially very effective app' has one major flaw: it must rely on the GPS of the smartphone in which it is installed. In the last few minutes I have apparently moved 750m, without actually changing my location. I would urge caution in declaring your position from the given GPS location, especially if in a building."
positive,Good for bushfire season
negative,How about adding the poisons information phone number as well?
neutral,We all need this app on our phone's
positive,Very good app especially on farm use. But one major concern. Address is not correct.  How old is the info for addresses?  Is there anyway they can be updated? Why isn't local Council address data base used for example?
positive,Good idea. Looks good. Gps coordinates correct however physical street location is wrong. Writren as the next street over despite the map clearly showing the exact right address
negative,Emergency
neutral,"Lucky this app is free. Idea was good app is bad. If the closest that the GPS on this app can get is within 850 metres of your location you are wasting time downloading it. To have full functionality this app must be able to ""turn on the GPS or remind the user to turn it on otherwise the location function is useless""."
positive,Has been needed for a while but hope we never have to use it
negative,A fantastic aid for or people who get lost in remote locations or for dementia patients who find themselves disoriented.
positive,We ride motor bikes and often not on a main Rd. A great comfort to have this app
neutral,Emergancy plus
positive,Great idea for people living on their own.
positive,Should be compulsory for all smart phones.
positive,"Excellent application, should be standard on all Australian sold mobile phones."
positive,Awesome idea. Thanks to our emergency service personal
neutral,Relevant my age
positive,Great app
positive,When you are trying to provide first aid it can be stressful enough without having to remember exactly where you are. This takes the guesswork out of it. Have used it in two real-life situations and it was great.
positive,Also wanted one where could add personal details such as next of kin book the social security number reward if find phone etc
neutral,But location is about 2kms out.
positive,"App looks great, however it shows my location in the correct spot on the map, but displays an address in the next street over. If I was not familiar with my current location, this could be the difference between getting help quickley, or having services turn up to the wrong place."
neutral,Needs an update to turn of GPS after exit its a real battery drain
neutral,Everyone should install this app in their phones especially in our childrens phones.
positive,"Fantastic idea ,but the app rips through the battery power. If this can be fixed then 5 stars."
positive,Hope this will help me!
neutral,But im in Victoria not N.s.w maybe each state should have there own
negative,Any reason why the phone number for the Poisons Information Centre isn't included in National Numbers? How does one give feedback or make suggestions for this product other than this review? Map showing nearest medical facility to ur location might be helpful for non locals.
positive,Saved my freinds dad's life
negative,"Seriously fix the battery, I have to manually crash the app to stop the life being sucked out of phone"
positive,The best app so far for any emergency. thumbs up!
negative,Emergency
positive,I've able all gps on my samsung G3 4G and samsung s5 and its found my location correctly. Well done. Keep up the great work
negative,Gives your location to emergency services in case you have an accident etc.
positive,You never know when you may need it for yourself or to help someone else. I recommend this app.
positive,I hope I never need it but am thankful I have it
neutral,"The first page shows your location, according to this app I was somewhere in a completely different street. Uninstalled."
positive,seems like a gr8 app and as a qas first responder it would of been very useful here in our rural township and surrounds but alas after installing on 2 diff phones the app froze on both phones and kept constantly turning my Samsung on and off. wat a shame. blessings
positive,Easy to use and accurate
positive,"Works flawlessly, really impressive. Glad it's free"
negative,"Will uninstall if they are True Blue, increasing their kill scores!"
negative,Poisons information number could be worthwhile
positive,Everyone should have this app on their device. It will save lives
negative,Good but address was about a kilometer out when I had to use it plus drained my battery
neutral,Very handy
neutral,It tells me I'm 3 streets away from where I actually am... have tried turning it off then back on again and still the same
positive,Especially the coordinates automatically turned on. A copy/paste of the coordinates would be good so it can be texted
neutral,Works
negative,"This keeps the GPS running long after exiting, killing battery life... in an emergency, a flat battery might be critical. Fix that and it'll be perfect. Workaround (easy): close the app from the ""recent apps"" menu. Workaround (advanced): if you use Tasker, create an exit task to completely kill the app when it's closed. That stops the background process running."
positive,"It is good, but the GPS needs to be turned off after it has an accurate location fix. Murphys law says that you will need the app when the battery is low. If the GPS stays on, then it won't be long before the phone dies. And that could mean more than just the phone!! . It also needs the ability to turn the GPS on like the 'find my phone' apps. . It needs a large widget so it can be placed on a home screen, and be readily accessible if It's needed. . bugger, ran out of characters...."
positive,It would be ideal if the GPS got your exact address right and not your previous address. Its no good if you wasn't able to communicate and you were depending on it.Just uninstalled it.
neutral,Power management issues
positive,Fantastic app
positive,"Clear, concise and a must have."
positive,"The apps layout, functionality and over all idea is great.. could be a very handy app.. GPS accuracy is off! I've tried multiple locations, time's of day, reinstalled the app.. pin points my location no closer then 3 blocks away even with every possible gps option selected on my phone.. google maps at least places a dot next door. Possibly fine tune that? But as said, great app otherwise. I understand I might be the only one with this issue."
negative,No review COmment
positive,Essential app that I hope I never get to use
negative,"Fantastic concept BUT everyone needs to carry either:- (1) a spare battery, or (2) a connectivity cable to charge the phone. The App drinks more gas from my battery than a Ferrari at full throttle. The battery drain makes the App useless as you can't turn it on/off at will and conserve power until it's needed. The IT developers really need to take a look at why is is so power draining. As for a RATING I rate the concept as 5* battery drain MINUS 5"
negative,"However, its true what others are saying, this drains my battery in about 3 hours since installing. Please stop it constantly using the gps. I have to kill the process to stop it."
negative,I will change the rating to 5 stars when the app closes the GPS on exit every time I exit it. On my HTC One it usually does not. I don't think it is a problem on iPhones but it needs fixing. Otherwise it is a brilliant app. In an emergency I would forget to check the GPS and end up with a flat battery when I need it most.
negative,No review COmment
positive,Good app
neutral,Why don't all smartphones sold in Australia come with this Pre-Loaded ???
positive,Worth while
positive,"Would be good to include a function where you could quickly send your coordinates to next of kin, trusted friend etc."
neutral,"First time opened, it showed pinpoint accuracy with the GPS function on my Samsung Galaxy s4"
negative,"Update. Tried to use the GPS location on the app to tell NRMA where I had broken down. GPS had me on the wrong road and had the NRMA turn up to the wrong location. Hate to think if it had been life or death. I have use the GPS on my phone with other apps and they were a lot more precise. Besides fixing the GPS issue, a suggested improvement would be to have the GPS give you the details of the Local Area Command you are in and give you a phone number to the relevant station."
positive,"Location correct to 10m on 3G & GPS, 10m on WiFi & GPS and 3m on GPS only. A handy app which I hope I never have to use, but will be nice to know it's there when I'm out bushwalking"
neutral,Tried installing twice. Didn't work.
negative,I've tried multiple installs/uninstalls but it crashes every time I try to open it. Obviously no one has bothered to fix the bugs that people have been reporting since it first came out.
positive,Great Idea to assist in the issues of emergency support
positive,"I saw the app and thought it was a great idea, so I downloaded it and tried opening it on my Galaxy Ace Plus. All I copped was that there was an error and that I had to close it. This happened the next few times that I tried to open it. I hope the developers actually read these because they need to fix this problem. An app like this isn't much use at all if I can't even open it!"
negative,Address house number not real accurate but good if you have no idea of where you are to start with and maybe have poisons info number as well
positive,"Free, easy to use and you never know when you may need it."
neutral,Wont even open in my android mototola.
positive,HTC Desire. App crashes every time I try to open.
positive,"Won't open, force closes on my HTC Desire."
neutral,Very usful app
positive,One app I hope I never have a need to use. Logged on in several parts of the city and every time it is pinpoint accurate with my location and address. Peace of mind.
positive,I had app for 4 hours in standby. It depleted the nexus 5 batt from 70% yet android system deemed it low batt use. But the batt use app states massive battery drain. Please fix.
positive,Thanks Marko
neutral,Just what travellers need
positive,Great application. Will recommend to friends and families.
positive,Great idea for an app. However its showing my location as 4-5km to the west of where I really am with gps enabled. Fyi when I went into my maps app it showed my correct location so it wasnt my phone playing up.
positive,"Would be great if Deaf people can use it, or a modified version be available for SMS texting mobile phone user's coordinates."
negative,Shows my location 3234m away. Thats ridiculous not even close. NOT GOOD ENOUGH
neutral,Everytime I go to open it the app crashes. So I can't use it at all
positive,Best with WiFi or GPS turned on but pretty accurate locations.
positive,This is an incredibly useful app. However GPS not always correct but if you turn WiFi on it picks up a signal it can better determine your location (obviously will only work in suburbia and near houses with wireless internet) this will app will hopefully provide easier response for emergency services and make telephonist's jobs slightly easier. Stay relevant stay on the line and always give contact details for DISPATCHERS to call if emergency services can't locate you or the emergency scene. It does happen.
positive,"I would like to say it works well but I hope never comes to that , but it is a great idea and easy to use well done."
positive,Wonderful and useful application keep up the good work
neutral,Much needed app that everyone should have. I wonder if it could be enhanced to send a SMS with the location at the time of the call?
positive,So many updates in 2 days uninstalled....just ring 000 and give em your number to triangulate
positive,"Good idea, but NSW based. I'll try it again, maybe, when it goes national."
positive,"The app crashes on start, I got it mostly to see how accurate the GPS was to my Garmin GPS handheld. But since it wont run on my Android phone, I guess I cant test it. Lost 4 stars for the crashing."
positive,"Excellent! Address shows my neighbour's, but I suppose that is good enough for the purpose of make an emergency call. Will be even better if it can be launched from locked screen without unlocking the phone, so anyone can pick up the phone and use the features."
positive,The map was slighlty off. But soon as the GPS came on the map was accurate. Highly recommended to anyine traveling.
positive,Best apps most most useful well done keep up the good work guy's
negative,Seriously...
negative,WTF?
positive,Gps is a little off but otherwise this app has the potential to save a lot of people.
positive,"A few streets off with the gps location, but the idea is great. Thanks vicpol for letting us know."
positive,"Seems Ok but can't set (correct) location from map, hopefully GPS cood automatically forwarded via data or SMS when actually making call."
neutral,"Read about his app in the weekend newspaper. Had trouble locating it. A search in Google Play does bring it up. Found the app via a search engine. Installed the app. It opens, but closes unexpectably. Have tried it several times; each time it crashes. Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus phone."
positive,A great idea for anyone really ..all phones should have this app as standard
positive,"This is a great idea and i really love it, but the gps isnt perfect on mine. The address it is located on, is atleast a 10 minute drive away from my address im at. If you can fix the gps on it, it would be perfect. Love the concept of it though! I will definitely keep it downloaded just incase."
neutral,This app just refuses to start. What do I do call 000
neutral,"Continues to access GPS after exiting the app, then crashes if the GPS is turned off."
positive,Great app but had to uninstall from my Nexus 5 as it was a massive battery drain...
neutral,"Not working on my Samsung Ace phone,hope to find out why? soon"
negative,"Unfortunately it doesnt work on a sumsung s2. Crashes everytime you open it.	Unfortunately it doesnt work on a sumsung s2. Crashes everytime you open it."
positive,Fantastic! Gives location and you can call the appropriate service directly from the app.
positive,"Instantly displays current street address. Very useful for Police Officers, to call in the address of an unexpected traffic stop in an unfamiliar neighborhood."
positive,"What a great idea, I hope I never need it, but to have the numbers and my location handy, it will be a lifesaver"
negative,"Very good idea, though I would suggest not giving street name and number until gps accuracy reaches a minimum level, to avoid emergency services going to the wrong address"
negative,Need ability to SMS the Lat Long details for times when you can only text information or when you have a weak signal
positive,Brilliant idea!!
positive,Please add feature that enables you to send your location/google map link to pre specified mobile number/s in case your phone is running low on baytery and can only get a text out
positive,"Great, about time this was bought out, great idea"
positive,Looks good. Nice clean interface. I've put it on my phone and my kids phones and I'd recommend others do likewise. Would be nice if there were a way to test it without an actual emergency happening but probably not really feasible. I'll assume the links to dial the numbers work ok.
negative,Though there are a few major flaws. There is no user prompt to turn on Location Services (GPS/WiFi) meaning you will end up with an accuracy of ~2km instead of <20m. You also have to force close the app in order to end it as it will keep GPS on if you don't.
positive,But works better if you have wifi as well as gps turned on. It had my location as being next door to where I was.
positive,"Hope that this is the ""bomb""! Thank you WA Police for letting me know about it."
positive,"Love this app and especially the addition of W3W. Would be awesome to have this as a widget to always show your location and also watch integration so you can have a complication on the Home Screen showing what three words locations for people hiking, exercising etc. easy way to get the information when youâ€™re already on the phone is to raise your wrist."
negative,"I recently loaded this app onto the shortcut screen of our family phones (mainly for the kids) with the expectation that I would never end up using it. 
This weekend, we had a fire in our garage where my husband was trapped and our garage door bolted closed, our home phone was out due to no power (thanks NBN) and I was trying to get my husband free. I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldnâ€™t find their phone so I grabbed mine. Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm -
It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door.
Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe. 
A brilliant app."
positive,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.
positive,"On last Friday night I suffered a crashing stroke. I was out on the bathroom tiles and couldn't talk, thankfully my wife was right there. She was a little flustered (understandable) and could not remember the number to call. She had this app on her phone and switch straight to the app and called the emergency number directly, also read the home address straight from the app screen.
I apologize if my words are mixed up, but I'm still recovering from the stroke.
I owe my wife for her recognition of what was happening and straight through to the help needed."
positive,"I had a serious fall mountain biking a couple of days ago. I managed to walk to the nearest fire road in a conservation area and gave my coordinates to the 000 operator. Our excellent ambo service had a 4WD in the park in good time, but took another hour and a half trying to track down which fire road I was on. I was in contact by phone but our maps were different. Eventually other riders spread out to guide them in.
Would have been much better if they had something to plug my coordinates in and guide them to me on an up to date map."
positive,Caution when reading out what 3 words over a phone to emergency services: their word list has similar sounding and pluralized words that may be misread by the operator and there are many examples of positions several km away with similar sounding names. There is security research on this topic. I would suggest incorporating other open source position readout protocols with better core technology.
negative,"* Valuable app which works well. 

* No clear channel provided to give feedback to app developer team - 000 website â€˜contact us for feedbackâ€™ page sends you off to a myriad of pages on Department of Home Affairs website :(

* Feedback on behalf of a visually impaired member of community: the location details may not be very easy for some people to see.

* Perhaps a future release possibly include an accessibility option whereby the user could press a button for the location details to be read out by the phone? [Google maps is able to read out directions even when the phone is on a call, so such a feature may be possible(?).]"
positive,Used this app in a remote National park in outback Qld when a group member collapsed. We got straight through and weâ€™re able to clearly communicate our location in the park (not near any of the camp grounds or roads etc) to the paramedics. We had no coverage and the sat phone wouldnâ€™t work but this app connected! Everyone who journeys in remote Oz should have this app.
neutral,"I would like to see functionality for this app to send location coordinates as an SMS to a programmed list of contacts. This button should share space with the others on the main screen. Ideally an emergency SMS should be able to use any network available, but Iâ€™m not sure how that could be implemented."
negative,"I had to use the app recently with the bush fire crisis I live in a no mobile service area and land line was damaged due to the fires. My husbands phone does not have mobile wifi so canâ€™t use it to dial 000, and only works while the internet is up. So downloaded the app thinking he can use it to dial 000 and found he couldnâ€™t the app told him to use his phone to dial 112 and that didnâ€™t work either - saying not available in the area. So he had to use Facebook messenger to phone me to ask me to call 000 I was 30km away. Donâ€™t waste your time"
negative,The what3words integration is genius and is exactly what Iâ€™ve wanted when sometimes the apps location description is occasionally off or too vague. It will also absolutely be vital for those lost in bush land who make calls. An absolutely must have!!
positive,Terrific idea but would be of limited value without my glasses. The words are very small. How about increasing the size of the three words to fill the screen after 10 seconds and also reading the words out to help people with vision impairment or illiterate.
positive,"This app is wonderful and surely has saved some lives. 
Please change the app icon back to the old one though. The newer orange logo looks too much like other app icons and blends in. Not good for finding in a hurry."
positive,I wish the app could give an on water lat/long we are having to convert the location given from this app to what we can use. Just the option to select the form would help. Otherwise itâ€™s a good app
positive,"The new app icon is much less â€˜emergencyishâ€™. I donâ€™t like it at all. The old one stood out as a â€˜click me nowâ€™ emergency button. The new one blends in. Iâ€™ll forget Iâ€™ve got it. In an emergency situation an app you can find super quickly is really important as you may not be thinking straight. 
Otherwise I still like the app."
positive,"Great app :-) I would also like to see the Military Grid Reference System added with long / latitude. 
Messaging option would also be a great feature to have also."
positive,"Concept and execution is great. However, I think it could be improved by adding the WhatThreeWords location in addition to the GPS coordinates. In stressful situations, quoting three short words is often easier to articulate than a string of numbers."
positive,"This is a great app. It would be even better if we were able to nominate it to not be archived to the cloud automatically if not used.. because you donâ€™t need it, until you do!"
positive,Great concept guys. We are frequent interstate holiday drivers and have come upon not so nice truck drivers harassing motorists in certain parts between rural NSW and VIC. Knowing where I am exactly can help in reporting trucks or accidents! I will be recommending this to friends and family.
positive,"I love the concept of the app and recommend it to friends, just hope I never have to use it.
The GPS font size adjustment is great but I don't understand why you don't adjust the street address below it using the same setting."
positive,"The app was so helpful.
It gives a perfect location every time.
The app has heaps of great features but, the app looks a bit tacky and there are buttons that I donâ€™t know what they do.
There are also no instructions on what buttons do so please fix this!!!
Overall I really like this app. Thanks!ðŸ˜"
positive,"Great app. Is it possible for the app to have greater accessibility functionality to support individuals who may not be able to identify their location, understand the operator and/or see/say the 3 words. 
Thank you"
negative,"Today, I got caught up in a traffic accident in rural SE QLD and needed to call the emergency services but had no idea how to describe where I was. I called 000 and used the app to give the operator the co-ordinates. Thanks so much a real life saver! Two patients quickly located and taken to hospital."
positive,I think you guys should approach Apple and make this app available in control centre so when phone is locked other people can use it still as that would help save life's and responds times
positive,"This app is the only app on my phone I hope I never have to use!
Iâ€™ve read everything on this app that I can find to read on it & without having used it, I still say itâ€™s the best app in my phone."
neutral,"I thought that the What Three Words software gave a unique set of 3 words to reference a specific map location, but when I tested this on 2 mobile phones sitting next to each other, the latitude and longitude were the same but the three words were different. Is this meant to occur?"
positive,"Emergency plus is a great app with a wonderful idea. My only suggestion is to include the number for the DAN (river alert network), so people in SCUBA emergencies know who to call. Otherwise a literal life saver app"
negative,"How can this be? It shows blue dot in correct place of my home, but the address named is a 3 minute walk away across a park. I then entered into Google Maps the GPS coordinates listed in the app as being my location. It also shows that the blue dot is where I am but the Emergency app address that I am supposed to give to a responder is not where I am. !!!"
positive,Great app so simple to use definitely a lifesaver would love to have it on my watch as I donâ€™t always have my phone within hands reach.
negative,Came across accident on country road no knowing where you relaid gps cordinates to operator and pin pointed out location to the meter. Saved a lot of time in trying to describe where we were
positive,"This has been a really handy app to have, but since the update, it wonâ€™t stay open. Crashes after a few seconds, even after deleting and re-installing. Please fix."
negative,"Overall, itâ€™s a great app, and will save lives. The emergency contacts are comprehensive, but could use mental health emergency contacts. This is of critical importance when responding to people who are psychotic or suicidal, and will not seek help on their own."
positive,Deleted and reinstalled and now it works perfectly.
positive,"Trying to teach my 3 yr old how to use it but he has to confirm to dial 000 3 times before it rings and then try to switch it to loudspeaker before he can hear it.

Would be excellent to have automatic dial and loudspeaker function with one touch from a locked phone. I understand risks with accidentally dial but itâ€™s too hard for a 3 year old in current format?

Maybe where it asks â€œcancelâ€ you can colour this red and â€œcall 000â€ make this green! Remember kids can read it needs to be picture or colour based for them. 

Can u pls fix!"
positive,W3W is too close to the bottom of the screen and obscured by the iOS app handle. Text is so small now. Old versions much clearer and easier to read.
positive,"Super useful app that everyone should have installed, the only thing I would recommend is if on the map the locations of near by defibrillators."
neutral,Has a list of all the services you could possibly need with a description below and a gps on screen.
positive,Would love app to include metronome for CPR rate. Doing CPR while waiting for ambulance can save lives but doing it at correct number of compressions is necessary.
positive,"Have now disabled this appðŸ˜ 
The new orange logo looks like the logo for our local Eyecare Plus Optical Store. The old RED logo with 000 was more easily recognised.
Also:
The address that shows for our house is incorrect. Shows the right road but house number is over a kilometre out."
positive,Great idea. Adding a way to freeze/copy location would be great for when out of range and need to move to call.
positive,"It would be nice if this was available for Apple Watch, as those who have the cellular version watches, are able to use it independently of their phone & frequently do."
neutral,Originally when I installed this app it proved to be very accurate but now itâ€™s not working as it should. Iâ€™ve deleted and reinstalled it but itâ€™s still not working properly. Can anybody help with this problem?
positive,Requires Live Location Sharing through the app!
negative,"My home address is rarely shown correctly, it goes all over the suburb. It's supposed to have an option to save pin onto home address but there's no instructions on how to do that, it's not user friendly. 3 words not reliable for an emergency call."
positive,"What a great idea. 
However, I just downloaded the app and it keeps on crashing less than 10secs after launch. 
Please fix."
negative,"On referring this app to my caravan group, the question arose about does this app still function in some basic way to alert emergency services?"
positive,Great app but have crashed once or twice on my iPhone X. The screen is still 16:9 so definitely needs a bit of updating.
positive,Would be good to have a list of the personâ€™s medications to communicate with emergency services.
positive,"Just saw the news segment on channel 9, and looks great, the idea behind it is fantastic so downloaded it... but it closes itself after 5 seconds. 
On iPhone 11 Pro. 

Think this bug needs to be fixed."
negative,Can you please add a feature to save medical info and emergency contacts that can be accessed from the locked screen by paramedics and doctors or police if they find you not responsive. Thanks.
positive,Should be focused more on kids and elderly. A watch function would be good.
positive,"Great app, but would like see the old logo return which was easily identified."
positive,"If had an area to document 
medicine or allergies of owner ,

Otherwise in all a good lifesaving product 
Thanks to the makers ."
neutral,Very handy app in emergencies but it has been two years since the last update. Still references a home button and does not utilise newer screen sizes.
positive,"I really want this app to work. However Iâ€™ve just downloaded the latest edition and the map is incorrect and the address is incorrect by more than 50m. Iâ€™m in a suburb at the moment so am a bit wary for using it mountain biking and using the locator for assistance. 

Happy to provide feedback if someone is willing to chat!"
negative,"Pretty useless when half of the location address is not displayed. App
supports just takes you to the Australian Government general webpage.... no way I could find to report the above fault....."
negative,"I couldn't find an answer but, can this be used on Apple Watch? And is so, are there only particular models or all models? I frequently collapse and can't reach my phone."
neutral,This app doesnâ€™t do very much and I cannot see why the police would even utilise the location as it doesnâ€™t provide an accurate location reading for instances it say Iâ€™m located 6kms from where I actually am.
positive,"Great app, would be nice to have it on the Apple Watch too"
negative,"Activated in my bag, crashed my phone and no emergency services arrived. Texted my contacts saying emergency services coming to me. Couldnâ€™t turn my phone off or reset phone. Caused my family worry as activated and could not deactivate."
positive,"This a great app overall, but I would love for it to have the functionality to make calls using soft phone apps, like 3CX and Zoiper"
positive,Hiâ€¦our staff have recently used this in Qld but our QFES and 000 operators where unfamiliar with the what 3 words functionality. Any guidance on when this will be rolled out nationally? Thanks!
negative,Since the update yesterday this app is now not working. It will only stay open for 1-2 secs and then disappears
negative,I had the previous version of the app which worked flawlessly on IOS12. I have just updated the app to get access to What3Words and now the app crashes within seconds. Very disappointing
negative,The new app icon or tile is not very appealing for emergency! It now blends in with everything else!!! Backwards move
positive,"Any chance of having the app icon in bright red, so can be easily identified among other apps? Audiovisual functionality would be great."
positive,Would be great to see public AED locations included in the app
negative,"This app uses a survey address from which my house is inaccessible, so using the app puts me at risk. Can you add a feature that allows an update of home addresses or a note?"
neutral,Since the update the addresses don't appear only the coordinates
positive,"000 ask what service you want, so you need to be conscious , then they need you to read your threewords W3W location which they had not heard of and would not discuss any further , as you lay dying..."
positive,"Amazing app
Bring out lots of new features and update for newer devices and all screen sizes"
negative,The newly updated app is useless. It crashes within seconds of being launched!
positive,"Canâ€™t share it ! 

Needs a button of option to share it with friends.

Needs promotion 
It is the best kept secret

Need a way to send the location without needed to â€˜tellâ€ it

Great idea
Great app otherwise"
negative,The new app icon design is a very poor substitute for the original.
positive,How easy is this.... awesome
neutral,Just downloaded and tested this app. It keeps crashing. It has also given 4 different three word descriptors of my location.
negative,"Needs to be able to send coordinates to an emergency contact/carer, for people who under Domestic Violence/stalking duress"
negative,"Why canâ€™t I stream video live to emergency services ?
What if Iâ€™m recording a crime in progress ?
What if Iâ€™m recording my attacker who then destroys my phone ? (Video evidence would be in the cloud if I could stream direct to 000) making catching the crim a lot easier.
The operator could provide advice that is more relevant based on what they are seeing

Come on people 
Itâ€™s 2019
We have the technical expertise 
Why arnt you embracing it ?"
negative,"Rang non urgent police line re dumped stolen items I found on Qld walking track, tried to use location on app operator said we donâ€™t use it and only google maps."
negative,"Accuracy seems to be problematic. When checking the app at home, itâ€™s so far shown me as being in three different locations, none of which are my home, and one up to 3km away."
positive,I too would love to have this app extended to Apple Watch (LTE version).
negative,"App crashes within seconds of being opened. 
Great idea but not good if itâ€™s not reliable."
neutral,The app only lasts on the screen at most 4 secs before it shuts down. It needs to stay open to provide the 3 words.
positive,It works just fine but the UI need to be updated to 2020 it looks like itâ€™s from 2007.
positive,Needs to support longer screens of the newer devices like iPhone X. Would also be good if this app supported the Apple Watch.
positive,Uptake Works for a second and then crashes full of bugs should never of been released please fix
negative,I get itâ€™s hard to fund this sort of app constantly and funding actual emergency services is more important than constant upgrades but seriously the iPhone X came out in 2017... No excuses for the lack of support for the screensize...
negative,Not very accurate. Gives location from next street to next door. Not very useful in an emergency.
positive,To incorporate what3words Is a fantastic move.
neutral,if you know you know
neutral,"Itâ€™s not accurate. the gps shows up as three houses down, not where I am at my house"
neutral,Only shows the last few letters of a place name such as â€œbergâ€ rather than Roseberg or â€œlandâ€ rather than Garland.
negative,Would send emergency services to totally the wrong place and actually cause more delay than help!!
positive,"This app crashes without fail within five seconds of opening.
Icon redesign is a step backwards.
W3W integration a great idea.
iOS 13.3.1"
neutral,The app thinks I am next door!
negative,CPR child video had no sound
negative,Gives the wrong GPS coordinates and address. Could be the difference between life and death.
negative,I live in the Blue Mountains. App turns off before it settles into my location. Serious failure IMO.
negative,App keeps closing. Only stays open for 10sec. Very disappointing.
neutral,It has the latest apple operating system
positive,"I have read many of these reviews regarding wrong location. On all smart Phones, (i have iPhone) Location Servives and Cellular as well as Bluetooth make Loaction much more accurate. However different parts of my house give 2 different strett addresses. This could make differsnce in an emergency. Is this the limitation of the App, the Phone or the Geolocation system? A more precise location would certainly make this App better 65 m is along way considering the number of satellites it is reading off.
DocOn Mac"
positive,Could this Very useful and important App revert to its previous BRIGHT RED colour. The Orange gets lost amongst my other similar colour Apps.
negative,Extremely outdated not safe to use
positive,"As a former emergency responder, I think â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display oneâ€™s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is â€œcriticalâ€ information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even thereâ€¦ For example, to find the â€˜CPR guidesâ€™ and â€˜fire alertsâ€™, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking â€˜More Informationâ€™ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either â€˜Royal Life Savingâ€™ or â€˜Fire Alertsâ€™.

This is way too many steps to access â€œcriticalâ€ information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldnâ€™t even realise that they could find â€œcriticalâ€ information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see â€˜Apple Watchâ€™ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to oneâ€™s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also donâ€™t understand why there is no support for â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ whatsoever.

I rarely know when â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ have been issued, because I donâ€™t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I donâ€™t use social media, so the only time I know thereâ€™s an â€˜Amber Alertâ€™ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)â€¦ If this application supported â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ or better yet, supported â€˜Amber Alertsâ€™ AND â€˜Apple Watchâ€™ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an â€˜Amber Alertâ€™ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etcâ€¦) to anybody in the affected areaâ€¦ As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

â€˜Emergency Plusâ€™ is an invaluable application to install on oneâ€™s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (â€œdraftâ€) applicationâ€¦ Whilst Iâ€™m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms."
neutral,here cause paul dillan told me to #itswatertime ðŸ§Žâ€â™€ï¸ðŸ§Žâ€â™€ï¸ðŸ§Žâ€â™€ï¸
positive,"Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times."
positive,"I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea. She thought so too but her feedback was that the coordinates were very small and difficult to read, especially if you were in an emergency situation and feeling dizzy etc. It looks like there is room to make the co-ordinates larger and perhaps black on white text would be easier to read especially for older people or if you're glasses have been lost/broken in an accident. Thanks :)"
positive,"If the app could automatically share the app users GPS location with Emergency Services i.e. without the app users intervention, it would be 5 stars from me.

The app is a genius concept. I'm telling everyone I know about it. I have some friends from a non-English speaking background I'll be installing this app for them."
positive,I had to call an ambulance for a life threatening emergency today. I was on an unfamiliar rural road and had so much trouble trying to explain my location. The guy almost died while the ambulance was delayed... I'm totally overjoyed to find this app as I can already see how essential it is... Should be compulsory for every motorist! Truly a great invention which will save lives!
positive,"The app info section says it was developed with valuable assistance of Vision Australia. Why then is the font so small and the GPS coordinates and address details so small?! In a stressful emergency, this info needs to be bigger. A previous review suggestion for the inclusion of the poison line and mental health emergency number numbers is a good idea. Overall though this app is a good. Having had to call 000 before on a remote road with no reference points, this app would have been very useful ."
positive,This app seemed like a great idea - very clear layout with easy to read GPS co-ordinates. Was about to load the app onto my mountain biking son's phone and noticed the current location was way off. Clicked on the map and noticed a disclaimer - 'accurate to 6000m' which makes the usefulness of the app questionable especially situations such as mountain biking reserves or national parks etc. 6km is quite a distance. Can't understand this inaccuracy - hopefully it can be fixed.
negative,"Today I used this app for this first time! A car accident in the middle of nowhere, I was as able to use this app to call emergency services and provide my location within 30 minutes police arrived with ambulance and fire truck a few minutes later!

A must have app for everyone!"
positive,Great idea but GPS location coordinates on the home page are too small to read. Unless you have 20/20 vision it is too hard to see the location and numbers. Other reviews have said this too. There is enough room on screen to increase the text size so why has this not been modified by the app developers? It is pretty crucial in an emergency to be able to read your GPS location.
negative,"If cross street, other emergency numbers like poisons, mental health and a spot for making notes of when u called were added then this would be 100% useful.

PLUS - where's a button for 112 when there's no mobile coverage? A total must.

Well done developers"
positive,"I haven't had to use this, but it would be great if you needed to. It loads really quickly so you're not waiting just to make the call, the location, for me anyway, was perfect, and it's laid out in an easy to use way, with various numbers in case you don't know whom to call. :)"
neutral,"When in an emergency and needing to read out coordinates to the 000 operator, many older or visually impaired people might not be able to read them out due to the numbers being very small. A person may not have their glasses with them or be able to find them in this emergency. An improvement on this app would be to enlarge these coordinate numbers. Thank you."
negative,This looks fantastic especially for isolated roads or beaches but I have a real concern that my young kids could accidentally ring emergency services if they play on my phone. Any chance of adding the option of using a password or something similar to access the app?
positive,"Loaded up and found my location (street address) perfectly.
Could be very handy in a rural situation where accuracy using Lat / Long coordinates would be much better. Out of WiFi range will take GPS in phone longer to establish accuracy."
positive,If there was an option to store your emergency info (like iEmergency) as well it would make it a very comprehensive app. And perhaps a source of information for emergency services if the patient was unresponsive on arrival. Please consider for next upgrade. I would happily pay to purchase.
negative,Why does the app still use gps in background when you don't give it those privileges? Still indicates it's in use even when not in the app and when you kill the apps. Battery drain not the best thing when you are in an emergency...
positive,"Yeah! This is a gr8 app! But it's a pity that you can't just press a button to share your location with pre-programmed Emergency Services or others members of your family or friends! By SMS, Email or Social Media! In future software updates, could you PLEASE add this facility! Thank you!"
positive,"This is brilliant, only thing that would make it better would be a share button to send link to to friends"
positive,"I really like this app! A few updates would be great... 
- address bigger
- 112 as a common number. For mobiles out of area
- a ""users"" profile that emergency workers can look up if required (name, dob, address, blood type, in case of emergency, etc) 
- a ""other"" numbers section."
neutral,Maybe add a feature that you can just send the operation instead of reading it out. There should be a button that you can press and it'll just send your immediate location.
positive,Should be included with the iOS automatically. Good to have all this info in one place with quick gps location. Recommended for everyone.
positive,Whilst the concept of this app is excellent I can not seem to get it to work in airplane mode or without sim. Perhaps an update is needed so that pressing 000 will actually dial 112 which is the universal number that will contact 000 in Australia even if you do not have a SIM card in your phone
positive,Simple to use and easy to understand. I recommend everyone has this on their phone. Haven't needed to make an emergency call yet but it looks easy enough for anyone to do.
positive,Great app wish it would send GPS position and you could also take a picture incase you witness something. A Must have app thank you
negative,Great app but it kept contacting emergency services while in my pocket. Felt bad for the staff there as I am sure they had better things to do. Great in an emergency not so great if you just want to throw your phone in your pocket and not create a major incident accidentally.
positive,"It doesn't happen often, but when I need to know which number to use for a situation I have found myself in, this app gives me the answers! Great job"
positive,"Haven't had to use the App yet, but have loaded on to all our devices. Simple design & well laid out. Nice to see location displayed clearly, this often difficult to know when you are stressed or in an unfamiliar place."
positive,An additional feature that could improve the app is a gps tracking system of emergency service vehicles travelling to the place of the accident/incident.
negative,"When visiting a relative at their house, she had bad accident was drifting In & out of consciousness. I'm not smart, neither is my cousin, so as he called triple zero, I got out the app and checked the address to tell the operator. A Lifesaving app!"
positive,"Downloaded to my iPhone, hope I never have to use it but it picked up my location and street address in Qld immediately, also gave my GPS coordinates, it was spot on. Great app."
positive,"Found my location exactly, with & without wifi . I think it would be great for my kids when not at home. Thank you"
negative,Would be even better if one or two photos of the emergency could be sent to 000 at the same time - e.g. of the fire being reported.
neutral,Turned wifi on and the location was exact!
positive,"This is a LIFE SAVING app!!! I'm sure it has already saved lives! Everyone please rate this app so more people will hear about it!
How many other apps save someone's life? Incredible!"
positive,"Great app but as stated by other users, the address has to be BIGGER! How can you tell the operator your current address or co-ordinates when not at home if they are too small to read? This app is still a must have."
positive,"Great app, helps Emergency services find you a lot easier if you don't know where you are. Recommend it to all your friends"
negative,Good app but needs a place to put the phone number of your own emergency contact person in case you can't tell responders
neutral,Took them a long time to start thinking it should have been out as soon as GPS phone was invented.
positive,Great for adults and kids alike. Easy to use. Can save emergency operators valuable time by you knowing where you are
positive,"How is it possible in these modern times, that a victim must double tap to return to this app for GPS co-ordinates (which are available on the included iOS Compass app anyway) in order to VERBALLY state their location??

Good suggestions in other reviews, but with a positive 4 star rating, I doubt those ideas will be implemented."
positive,Awesome not only does it have all the emergency numbers in one place also tells you were you are..great idea.
positive,It'd be good if it actually had my location correct instead of 20km away and not giving me the closest address I'm afraid that's not going to be much good the ambos if they can't find me or is it just accurate for NSW and not any other state ??? Definetly needs some updating done on it before I consider it useable
positive,Works well and could easily save lives directing emergency services to the correct location.
positive,Read about this app today and had to get it. It is a great idea. I hope I never have to use it but glad I have it just incase
positive,The non urgent police line isn't a national service as is health direct. The app should be state specific depending on the location identified by the app. Eg Nurse on Call in Victoria or the local police station number.
positive,I hope I don't use it but it would certainly help me if I needed. It's on my home page ready to go.
positive,I tested the GPS coordinates and it placed me only 10m from my home. It feels very reassuring to have access to a potentially life saving app
positive,This app has the potential to save many lives. I highly recommend it.
positive,I have used this app when I got a flat tire on my car. I could tell the RAA where I was which is helpful.
neutral,This app should come standard on all iPhones in Australia. Quite possibly the handiest app to have.
neutral,"Just downloaded this app because I thought it would be very handy in giving your exact location in an emergency, only to find my location was out by 3+kms which is concerning."
positive,"Great to see an app that truly is a serious emergency necessity and lifesaver should one need it, hopefully never; but it's there just in caseðŸ‘ðŸ¼

Brilliant, Great & Terrific ðŸŽ‰"
negative,"We are the ones that brought this concept to the emergency sector and government after Years of Meetings and emails,plane trips, selling our idea and procedure trying to get this concept through to 000. But instead they stole our time took our ideas and go ahead release there own!"
positive,Love this app! It knows where you are even when you don't.
negative,"Just downloaded this app so I was just checking it out at home and the map location is so wrong that it would cost someone their life.
 I mean, not just a couple of houses out, like a totally different road about 9 or 10 kilometres away !!!! Just so wrong!"
negative,"Stopped at an accident near Gembrook today. Used this app and despite telling the emergency phone operator the GPS coordinates, this did not help the operator to work out where we were. After a long conversation describing local landmarks the ambulance was finally dispatched. Disappointed."
positive,Tried it to see if it would work and picked up my location straight away!!!!
negative,App reports that I am on a particular road when I am in fact not. When I check on other services it shows my correct location. Would be dangerous if I reported the Emergecy plus location to 000.
positive,"Great app. But there should be a way in order to share and track location with 000 operator?
As in ""find iPhone"" type feature."
positive,Long time coming... Idea is old!!! Good to have but may use once in a while.
negative,Battery drain on both iPad and Samsung very high could render useless in emergency this is due to gps always on locating coordinates I guess
positive,"App has everything, this app is so valuable it could save Someone's life if not your own!
Well done Fire and Rescue NSW! :D"
positive,Great app but needs locations of public access defibrillators on a map and maybe a metronome 100bpm
positive,What an awesome App... I have only just downloaded it. But the fact it uses GPS is fantastic.... Well done to those involved..... ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
positive,"Excellent App but in a future update can you please include the nearest cross street, it's distance and direction? I usually get asked for that before GPS co-ordinates."
neutral,Found my location in an instant. Very accurate and precise.
positive,"Good app, something that should been round long before now."
positive,Funny... this app is strangely similar to the 'Call 000' app released months before - providing a Lat and Long and the ability to dial direct to 000 from the app itself. Works ok.
positive,It's a must have must use. This app could save your life people! Use it!!
positive,"Location is spot on. 
Great idea.?"
neutral,Should be included as a default app.
negative,"I've just added the app on my iPhone and the location is not where I am, problem?"
positive,"Every Aussie should have this on their smart phone!
Great app!"
positive,I'm at a street address 200m from a station yet the app located me as being in an underground tunnel. I want precision in locality identification before I can confidently recommend use of this app to several hundred in my workplace.
negative,The gps coordinates are no where close to my address. Think you need to address this issue
positive,Lucky I have never needed to use this - location is way off!!
negative,Please add the number for the 24hour statewide Mental Health Line and the 24hr Poisons Information Centre. Then it will be 5 stars!!!!
negative,Off by a house which could be a problem
negative,Just downloaded the ap. I'm at home in a rural area. If I called emergency services and gave the location they named they would be sent to the middle of a farmers paddock 2km away.
positive,The idea is old but would probably use it once. It's good incase of an emergency.
negative,Street is correct house number is wrong rural area
positive,Brilliant!
positive,"Tip top app, recommended at a tip top chat from a tip top bloke"
negative,This app is very inaccurate regarding location. For my address it's 4 kms out. Dangerous. Can it be fixed please to be correct.
positive,"Recently speaking with a 000 operator friend about the App and the biggest issue they said is that the current 000 dispatch system apparently requires a street and nearest cross street for a dispatch. Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"". Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is. I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once. Or make it that the 000 operator can gain a street address from the displayed Lat/Long and work out a cross street themselves."
negative,The recent update causes the app to crash
positive,Excellent idea and we'll implemented.
negative,The update freezes and nothing happens.ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
neutral,App puts address as 3 kms from where I actually am.
positive,This is a life saving app. Well done....
neutral,Where can I find out the price of this app?
positive,Recommended by the legend himself Paul Dillon
positive,Excellent
negative,"App is frequently advertised by emergency services, however it has not been updated for 2 years and references the now non-existent â€˜home buttonâ€™ in the instructions. It also does not fit on the screen for an iPhone X and up (XR, XS, 11, etc). 

The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: â€˜13-2500â€™ is listed when it should be â€˜132 500â€™. 

Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.

This app could be helpful, however in its current for it either needs to be updated or advertising by emergency services needs to cease."
positive,Great app. Another useful emergency contact number might be the Poisons Information Centre No. 13 11 26. Could be useful for sea-life/bush/home related emergencies....
negative,"Emergency+ lift your game, when I put my phone next to my partners he is accurate to 10 metres? But I am almost 14 and a half kilometres away! Emergency services would never find me."
negative,"Location gets worse every time I turn it on. Currently accurate to 45252 metres, which is about how far wrong it is. Cannot recommend anyone should use this app."
