1,"Locates correctly but can give an address 800m / 8 streets away. ""Last updated"" text can also be odd: ie ""19 years ago"". Must have to let it take time to settle down. SGS10.",3,-1,2022-10-24

5,"Rendering assistance to a lone dehydrated aged sailor at water's edge reporting as a ""concern for welfare"". Frustratingly with no road and no x-street to pass to 000 it was simple as saying Alpha, Bravo, Charlie where GPS and three words was spot on in guiding the ambulance close. ""if we can't find you we can't rescue you"", and day or night not all calls for assistance come with an observable street address or for that matter even on ""Land"", that's within a three metre square. Well done W3W.",5,-1,2022-09-25
6,Great app. Sister put me onto it. Shame there is no way to update the home location as a gps location does work for when you are multi level residential building.,4,-1,2022-09-22
7,"Dangerous app. It thinks I am at my old address, some 50km from where I actually am. GPS won't update. Waze picks up my location correctly so it isn't a GPS or phone issue. This app is dangerous, it could send emergency services to the wrong location. It would be safer not to have the app and use street signs or landmarks or GPS coordinates from your phone to report your location.",1,-1,2022-09-16
8,Great 'just in case' app. Truncation of 'what three words' in primary and map screen may be problematic (unless font size significantly reduced impacting vision impaired individuals). When tapping info box from map screen all text increases in size and often pushes last of the 'three words' out of view/access. Better highlighting of additional services accessible through the menu may also assist those who haven't explored app prior to their emergency/crisis.,4,1,2022-09-13

17,This is a must have. If your unsure of the address were the emergency is just touch the app. There it is. All you need to get help.,5,-1,2022-08-02

21,"Not displaying my location correctly, more than 3km out.",2,0,2022-05-21
22,"Your app sometimes displays the ""what3words"" text wrong between the ""Home"" screen and the ""My Location"" screen. At times on the ""My Location"" screen, the 3rd word is missing letters at the end of the word. But on the ""Home"" screen all letters appear. Thus, different words can be displayed when at the same location on the 2 different screens. If this review is monitored and your require clarification I have screenshots to illustrate.",4,-1,2022-05-20
23,Awesome... everyone should have this app as it may just save your life or the life of a loved one .,5,1,2022-05-15
24,Thank you You,5,1,2022-05-03
25,"Info blurb says (in the ""app permissions"" section) that you can disable access to permissions in settings. After downloading, the ONLY settings option is to change the font size of GPS coordinates... a blatant lie - not cool. Why should this app need access to the storage of my phone??",2,-1,2022-04-15
26,"The so is generally good. I'd give it 5 stars but... the app has no exit option. Once started this app runs continuously until a Force Stop is used in settings, applications. This app only needs to run on demand NOT continuously. Please fix this flaw. It affects battery.",4,-1,2022-04-12

33,"Great app spot on for locations, it is really good to have",5,1,2022-02-27
34,"Great and simple app, but accessibility is poor. It would be vastly better for older folk (or the vision impaired) if the required information wasn't in tiny text that's hard to read. It wastes a lot of screen space that could be better used.",3,1,2022-02-26
35,Good to use easy to connect with people,4,1,2022-02-20
36,Love this app as you can provide a precise location if required. One thing that could make this more useful would be the ability to put a widget on your lock screen to allow instant access if needed similar to the emergency call option on lock screens. I have a medical app that provides my medical history etc and the widget gives instant access to my information in an emergency without having to unlock my phone.,5,1,2022-02-15
37,"This is an app everybody should have on their phone. For the average, untrained person, it can be extremely difficult to think rationally in an extreme emergency due to adrenaline coursing through your system that often leads to panic. Giving information such as your whereabouts if you are in an unfamiliar place can make things worse. This app can lessen that sense of panic by giving you everything you need at your fingertips and if you don't know where you are what3words is just brilliant.",5,-1,2022-02-02

44,Just call 000 actually tried to use this app during an emergency and it didn't work. I ended up calling 000,1,-1,2021-11-11
45,"The concept of this app is sound and useful, however it's very hard to read for those who have less than ideal eyesight. Surely this must be obvious? An emergency app. is for everyone, not just for those with perfect vision! Get with it!",3,1,2021-11-11
46,App is recommended by Australia Wide First Aid... gives your exact location when talking to required emergency,5,-1,2021-10-30
47,"Please change the map/location functionality so that one tap anywhere on the lower half of the screen immediately makes it full screen with large text. At the moment it requires two taps to do this which hardly anyone is going to know. Also add large text ""Tap here for location information"". Great app otherwise.",4,1,2021-10-28
48,"Location map is utterly broken and therefore pointless, and dangerous to rely upon. Just use Google Maps and share your location with a friend via SMS if you're lost.",4,-1,2021-10-25
49,I can't copy my long-lat or what3words to a text message. Please allow/ encourage copy for this. Data takes less power and signal.,4,1,2021-10-25

57,Look good so far,5,1,2021-08-31
58,This is a great app but is there some way of getting the 3 words other than using your gps location. I would like to add the three word for location to evacuation plans.,5,1,2021-08-30

64,"Sorry, not happy Jan. what3words is a confusing addition to what was a user-friendly app - since usurping my Emergency+, I have not had a correct street address reflected and I now live about a kilometer away at the entrance to the dog-walking park instead of at an address, with actual Unit #, that used to be reflected. The 3 words applicable to my life vary from front to back door and indeed upstairs to downstairs. Now not confident that the authorities would find me in an emergency.",1,-1,2021-07-05

67,Great app get it ready for when you need it.,5,1,2021-06-24
68,"Good start. You need to add a share button to copy the what3words location, or to automatically share with a person ( via messenger or WhatsApp for example) or even share directly to emergency services. As well, add a live tracking service so that when we are out by ourselves we can share realtime location with a friend. Also have it so it alerts the friend with a notification after X minutes of not moving. Let the tracked user set how many mins of standing still before alert is sent.",3,1,2021-06-18

70,Cool,5,1,2021-06-01
71,I hope it works when needed..,4,1,2021-05-23
72,"Not the smartest design for what is supposed to be an emergency app. For one, and probably most importantly it should 'force start' location services (GPS) rather then relying on user activation. A kid may not know how to do this, or become confused. What3words is a joke. Fine if you speak fluent English, but not everyone does. Why couldn't a system of 2 letters and one number have been implemented instead, such as A3E. Cleary readable and pronounceable by everyone.",2,-1,2021-05-19

74,Not accurate with location! At least a minimum of one street away!,2,0,2021-05-09
75,Awesome app emergency services helps pinpoint your location by three words marking system easy to repeat over the phone. Just wait upto 30 seconds for it to work the GPS. It gives location without cell connection.,5,1,2021-04-19
76,"Integrating W3W isn't a crash hot idea. It's literally a proprietary system. Plus codes would have been smarter, conforms more with the Digital Service Standard (due to it being open source) and relies less on people being fluent in English. Not just me though, reading some of the other reviews complaining about the different words appearing suggesting better word combinations, but that's now something that the devs now have zero control over.",2,1,2021-04-08

82,Appears to be good. I haven't tested it in an actual emergency yet but it got my address right which is a good start.,5,1,2021-03-01
83,"Upon opening the app for the first time it had me located across the street at my neighbours house but I closed and opened again and the location was correct so all good. My concern would be the words used, I watched a few times and some of the words I felt may be too hard to pronounce for some people, so maybe an update could keep words under maybe 5 letters. Otherwise, what a brilliant app :)",4,1,2021-03-01

89,"ALL FONTS NEED TO BE MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LARGER. I need glasses to read, but in an emergency may not have them or be able to reach them.

96,"Love the concept, haven't use this in emergency but i think the 3 word concept could be improved to be more inclusive for people with visual disability or non english speaking people...or if you are about to pass out. Say maybe press a button to send a location signal or it reads out the 3 words for the caller.",4,1,2021-01-20

98,"Unfortunately, the location is way off. It continues to pin point me on the other side of town which would be a huge problem if it were an actual emergency. The concept is good though, the app itself is very responsive and easy to understand.",3,1,2021-01-17
99,"Downloaded to consider as an option for an elderly relative in a remote location who may need to call ambulance. Unfortunately, text size defaults are difficult to see and not clear if it can be changed... highly recommend updating to improve usability for sight challenged users and other user groups who could struggle with the interface. We will print what3words co-ordinate for our relatives property and put in their wallet and on their fridge, but not ideal if they are moving around.",2,-1,2021-01-16

103,Fortunately I have not had to use this app. However it looks exactly what I would need should the occasion arise.,5,0,2021-01-09
104,Without having actually used it in an emergency ...initially it located me next door but after going back and forth between location and home ( where I was) on the app it adjusted to the correct address. I particularly liked being able to put the location display on large writing. When I wear sunglasses I can only read large print. Also good to press just one button.,5,1,2021-01-05
105,"Unfortunately this app puts me 7 houses away from my correct location, and there is no way to correct this ,that I can see. Not good enough for an emergency situation. Ill tell emergency my 3 words from that app myself.",2,-1,2021-01-01

108,Thanks to the team at the National Triple Zero Awareness Work Group for updating the app. It is now working very well on my phone. Hope I don't have to use it.,5,1,2020-12-21
109,Ever since this app was updated it is now giving incorrect addresses. It is telling me that I'm at 36 when I'm at 47. When I was in a different area it was telling me I was at number 5 when I was at 25 that is a big difference. Not very good if you do not know where you are and need help. You need to look into this and make it more accurate it's not only on this advice it was on two other advice .,3,1,2020-12-18

Simply tap the App.... and then tap the 000 button (or other if you wish) and you are ready to communicate with the operator. At the bottom of the screen was my exact position... wow. How good is that? I mean if you are lost, it is also helpul to see where you are. Should be compulsery for all phones in Oz. For a lousy $1.29 it is almost classed as free.

On the following screen, the address, co-ordinates and the 3 words are visible as they should be. The location on the map is not shown, because it is not centered, and is out of bounds of the frame. The 3 word system is smart, however, as I hold the phone, the words are changing constantly. This could lead to misunderstanding with the operator. Australia is a developed and wealthy country. It should adopt a system where the location of the phone is sent out on a touch of a button.

This opportunity, and many others in the past, must be seized upon and the media used to educate and reinforce the need for all persons to have this app on their phone and to know how to use it.  I have used app before, as a Police Radio Dispatcher.  5 teenage girls were lost in bushland in winter at night. Police had been searching for them for some time but the girls didn't know where they were and a triangulation from there phone only showed a rough area. The supervisor was about to call in a helicopter to assist in the search. I called back the young girl's phone and asked if she had the Emergency+ app on her phone. She didn't but she did have internet connection so I was able to talk her through the download. Within minutes  I had her location PINPOINTED through the lat/long coordinates. Using mapping we were able to walk the girls to a close by track whilst coordinating Police to walk in from the nearest road.

The dispatcher reported their maps do not show the off-road walkways and cycle paths that are clearly available on the app, and googlemaps and openstreetmaps. Or did he transcribe the coordinates incorrectly ? It appeared the dispatcher was not looking at the same map as we could see on the app. It would vastly improve communication if the application were able to upload the coordinates to the 000 dispatchers via an internet or SMS link. It would also be a very useful extension if the application could share the coordinates via SMS or internet links to Council or National Park Rangers etc.,. who may need to unlock gates for ambulance and police to reach incident sites.",4,1,2016-01-16

The App drinks more gas from my battery than a Ferrari at full throttle.  The battery drain makes the App useless as you can't turn it on/off at will and conserve power until it's needed.  The IT developers really need to take a look at why is is so power draining.  As for a RATING I rate the concept as 5* battery drain MINUS 5",1,-1,2014-03-01

I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldn’t find their phone so I grabbed mine.  Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm -
It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door.
Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe.

755,I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.,5,1,2021-09-18

856,"As a former emergency responder, I think ‘Emergency Plus’ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display one’s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.

The application does need a fair bit of work however.

Firstly, there is “critical” information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even there… For example, to find the ‘CPR guides’ and ‘fire alerts’, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking ‘More Information’ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either ‘Royal Life Saving’ or ‘Fire Alerts’.

This is way too many steps to access “critical” information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldn’t even realise that they could find “critical” information like this deep in the menu.

It would also be nice to see ‘Apple Watch’ support integrated.

Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use ‘Emergency Plus’ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to one’s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.

I also don’t understand why there is no support for ‘Amber Alerts’ whatsoever.

I rarely know when ‘Amber Alerts’ have been issued, because I don’t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I don’t use social media, so the only time I know there’s an ‘Amber Alert’ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)… If this application supported ‘Amber Alerts’ or better yet, supported ‘Amber Alerts’ AND ‘Apple Watch’ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an ‘Amber Alert’ is active.

Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, ‘Emergency Plus’ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etc…) to anybody in the affected area… As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.

‘Emergency Plus’ is an invaluable application to install on one’s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (“draft”) application… Whilst I’m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.",2,1,2022-03-22

858,"Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS.

941,"Recently speaking with a 000 operator friend about the App and the biggest issue they said is that the current 000 dispatch system apparently requires a street and nearest cross street for a dispatch. Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display ""Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street"" or ""Willy Rd, 200m South of High St"".  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once. Or make it that the 000 operator can gain a street address from the displayed Lat/Long and work out a cross street themselves.",3,1,2016-12-24

950,"App is frequently advertised by emergency services, however it has not been updated for 2 years and references the now non-existent ‘home button’ in the instructions. It also does not fit on the screen for an iPhone X and up (XR, XS, 11, etc).  

The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: ‘13-2500’ is listed when it should be ‘132 500’. 

Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.

This app could be helpful, however in its current for it either needs to be updated or advertising by emergency services needs to cease.",2,-1,2020-01-05

I'm sure docs would love for someone to come in with a burn with broken skin where someone poured coke or orange juice over the burn.  Another example is under diabetic emergency they are talking about low blood sugar and then cite the problem as a lack of insulin.  After being a diabetic for over 40 years, I can tell you low sugar is caused by too much insulin.   Only being a diabetic in itself is a lack of insulin, not the emergency they are talking about.

Could a brief section about flood/storm safety info be added in a future update? Adding all the separate apps available on the Google play store seems excessive to me but that's from so  Also a training course for Mental Health emergency care seems like the next step in raising awareness and taking stigma away from mental illness.

This may be fine for normal stings, but in the case of a severe allergic reaction/deadly venom this would decrease chances of survival because this will speed the spread of venom.  The ironic thing is that I learned this in an American Red Cross Course this year. Also in the section on recognizing symptoms of brown resluse/black widdow bites it describes black widdow twice and doesn't include brown recluse.  It would also be advantageous to have pictures of the snakes that it lists as venomous as their names mean little to most people.",4,1,2017-05-17

If you want to help somebody in an emergency this is a step in the right direction...then take it to the next level and get Certified.     You're insane to think they need to have wilderness survival & Monsanto disclaimers.  As far as silly ANSWERS...they do that on PURPOSE to eliminate confusion.

NO - Should everybody at least check it out? YES!  Online everybody's a critic & reviews are a chance to show off arrogance & negativity!!!

2075,"I was frustrated to see that some points in the app were not consistent with the 2011 standards in many categories.  - Unconscious Breathing- they did not check for consciousness, and are using a recovery position that is not what is taught in class. - Burns says to use water for 10 minutes and to use plastic wrap on the injury if bandaging is needed. Neither is in any of the class materials (although the plastic is a good idea.) - General lack of basics such as checking the scene, getting consent, checking for conciousness, etc.  Most of the stuff on it is rock solid and consistent, and the few minor quibbles are not a big deal really.

How do you expect a blind person to be able to be able to touch the spot where you put a tourniquet. Come on! You’re the American Red cross. You should be able to get this right.

I installed this app several years ago. At that time there was no quiz section but these days it has. The quiz section is really helpful. Through quiz I could assessed not only my knowledge was right but also corrected wrong knowledges previously I had and got some new informations.

I do like using the app to fill out the Rapid Pass, but I won’t be using the app to do any scheduling from now on. I also don’t like depending on the app to keep track of all my donations.

2277,"Everyone, who is not already an expert in first-aid, should have this app or a similar one on their phone.  It gives good advice for a variety of situations where you could help someone, even perhaps saving their life.

I don't understand the few reviews I've seen that say the app is dumbed down.  In some situations there's simply not much a non-expert with no equipment could do, except to call 911.  The fact that ""Call 911"" appears early and often in the list of steps is NOT a meaningful criticism of the app.  Even an expert should do that, as an ambulance and hospital are simply better equipped to help than even the most expert person who has no equipment with them.

There is only a small chance you will ever need to use this app, but if you do need it, you don't want to be waiting for it to download.  Get this app.

I do have one criticism of the app.  It can list nearby hospitals.  This would be a great feature, except its database includes even specialty hospitals with no ER.  Seems like a first-aid focused app should only be listing hospitals that have urgent care facilities, perhaps even separately indicating ""Emergency"" vs ""Urgent Care"" locations.  The closest hospital to me, for instance, is the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.  Fortunately, in that case the name is a give-away that urgent care will not be available there.  But what about similar specialty hospitals where it's not obvious from the name that urgent care will be unavailable?",5,1,2014-08-31

I downloaded this app thinking it would cover things like proper field dressing of a wound in order to get someone to the help they need, but instead it only tells you to keep pressure on the wound, call 911 and wait for help to arrive. Completely useless of you are in an area or situation where help cannot be counted in to arrive on a timely manner such as hiking in the backcountry or in the middle of a natural disaster. Not to mention the bites and stings section doesn't even attempt to cover snake bites, only insect stings. And the anaphylaxis section gives you no help in managing the anaphylaxis until help is available, only "" if the person is suffering from anaphylaxis call 911"". God forbid anyone have an accident outside of cell coverage. Seriously all of these 5 star ratings must be the developers friends and family or people who have not even the slightest clue what first aid actually is, this app will not save anyone's life ever. It is very incomplete and like I said is basically just a 911 button.

2282,"So the idea of this app is great!  I love the layout and info., although some of the grammar could be better, but the tests do not work properly.  For instance, I answered all of the questions correctly for the bleeding test, however it only said that I had one correct answer.  The reason I know I was correct on the other questions, aside from being confident in this knowledge already, was that the test showed the answers for the ones you get wrong, and ""correct"" for what you get right.  In the written answer area, it stated all of the correct answers, which were the ones I gave, but it didn't give me the credit for them.  When I tried several more times it would only give me credit for one more answer, even though they all should have been correct from the start.  I tried the allergy test, another area that I am competent in, and it did the same thing, but this time for  2 of the 5.  It's a shame!  The tests are a fun idea, but don't work.

I've taken the all the tests on the app (and have gotten 100%), and for the broken bone test I selected the two correct answers for what to do to when someone comes up to you with a broken arm, which is to hold it and support it with a cushion. The app still marks it wrong even though I've put in those answers about 10 times. Other than that this app should be on every single persons phone in the entire world because emergencies happen everyday and you can never be prepared for them without this app or proper training.",4,1,2016-01-07
2284,"The Red Cross takes the same line that many corporations and all governments do. Namely, you're too stupid to understand all but the simplest information. You can't be trusted to handle anything requiring thought or imagination! So, just shut up and do what you're told and nobody will get hurt. 
Unfortunately, in many cases, people WILL get hurt without enough information then and there at the scene while waiting for the ambulance to arrive! So, instead of offering enough facts for you to try to help the injured person, they usually just give the skimpiest of information and tell you to have someone else (NOT YOU, remember, you're too stupid to be able to make a call while you sit there ""reassuring"" the person) call 911!!! 
I don't understand how people can not only listen to this patronization, but give it 4 or 5 stars!

The hamster was caught underneath his pull up bar and was squirming. I rushed downstairs and started yelling: ""Tod are you okay?"". He spiritually answered me and I started screaming at the cats to get help. They ran and i moved in to help Tod.

With all my might, i pulled him out and brought him to the baby changing station i had installed in my kitchen. i took this grate class in medical scool so im rellly good at first ade. I kept pushing down on him while i was looking at this ap thing. It said to give CPR to the individual and push down as hard as possible and so i did and Tod was crushed to death when i brought a pickaxe from my job.

The more i think about it Tod was fine and i didnt need to do it. i keep him in a garbage bag and mourn his loss every day with his shrine in the kitchen. One of the cats never came back and the other four came back.

While in most circumstances that will be fine in the event of an disaster ie. a hurricane when power and network connectivity is unavailable the first aid information wouldn't be available.

In this case, the emergency didn’t require a 911 call nor a trip to the ER. All that I needed was a simple step by step guide to address the situation. This app didn’t deliver. I ended up having to find what I needed on the internet. Now, I was glad that at least there were instructions to call 911. And, there are ways to determine if that’s even needed.

2290,"The emergency preparedness kit list is good, but since it is a list of very basic suggestions, I would add a propane camp stove, several small fuel canisters, matches, and at least one battery powered LED lantern. Being able to cook food is a huge stress reliever, especially in a cold climate.

One gallon of water per person per day does not allow washing anything, so also paper plates, cups, napkins, disposable cutlery, and trash bags. 

All of the above could be added for less than $150 (the stove and fuel would be about half the total) and would make a very meaningful difference in stress levels. Not everyone would spend the money or storage space, but those who do would be far better prepared. Reducing stress levels is critical. Hot food and a decent light help a lot.

I would also like to see sunburns added. I got one of those today, and to my surprise, help for that wasn't in this app!

Something about ""Wild animal bites"" might also be helpful. I was bitten by a stray/ferrel cat a while ago, and didn't do anything about it, not knowing what to do. I did a school report on rabies a while afterwards, and it got me thinking, what if I get bit by another animal. :)

It really shouldn't be used in an emergency, but is a good reminder of what to do if you find yourself needing to treat someone in an emergency.

You should always get certified by a professional and do the hands on training, but the certification could be 1-2 years, so it's good to take refreshers if you're not an EMT or RN.

Good basics and simple run down of what to do. I recommend this not for those who have no background, but for those who need the refresher. However, if you can't afford to take the classes or are cannot get to any in your area, this is the next best thing.

The earthquake app keeps me well informed concerning the activity in my area which is almost constant. The first aid and other apps have performed great. I look forward to the new apps they are working on now. Thanks again Red Cross for saving lives Daily!

2311,"I am a big sister, a nanny, a wife, and a mother-to-be. I'm currently studying to become a health educator and when I finish that I hope to get my EMT certification. So people trust me to know this stuff. Of course I have had first aid training, but in the heat of the moment it can slip your mind. I love having this app so that I can brush up on my skills just a little bit everyday. It helps me feel so much more prepared and safe.",5,1,2014-08-18
2312,"It's helpful if you're in a place where 911 can easily be called and help can arrive but... What happens if you're camping in the wilderness or are far away from any hospitals...? Like the person said below, give us more knowledge. Also in the test section, some of the answers to choose are pictures, not words, and I can't see the picture. Fix this big and offer more information for people who are far away and cannot get help. Watch ""I shouldn't be alive"" and see what I mean...",3,1,2013-08-04
2313,"Everything about this app is useful when minutes count. I find myself using it just to educate myself if something happens to come up. 

There is one issue, would someone check the spelling and grammar (I saw some mistakes in the Diabetes section).

Otherwise I would greatly recommend this app. I'm even going to upload it to my wife's phone for if I experience a Diabetic episode.",5,1,2012-07-03
2314,"It's a awesome app but the only problem I have is the quizzes answers are sometimes too easy. Like ""how do you stop bleeding?""
A. Go to the mall
B. Apply pressure with a clean cloth

And I kinda wish they would tell you what to do if you can't call a ambulance (like no cell service or in the wilderness). But this is still a awesome app that I definitely think everyone should have! 😃",5,1,2015-08-21
2315,"I like all the prepping info and all the emergency tips etc. However, anytime I try to select one of my locations, the app crashes. The ""up to date"" maps of active storms are useless. They're ridiculously small, have no additional information outside of the radar picture, and throughout Sandy, seemed to be at least an hour behind. Having the prep info, and the aftermath help is great, but don't rely this for info during the storm.",3,1,2012-11-09
2316,This app is mind blowing. One day on June 23 I really needed this app because my friend had a heat stroke and I didn't know what to do so I took him under a tree and I called 911. They told to look for something to help him while they send officers to where I was. I found this app and before the ambulance arrived he was a lot better. Without this app my friend would be in the hospital. THANK YOU RED CROSS.,5,1,2015-06-30
2317,"Every1 should get this app. It had so much information in it! I couldn't believe it's Free! It's  Easy to understand. The Red Cross is wonderful they helped my Family & I after R house fire, put us up in a hotel that night & gave my 2nd grader a bag of toys & games, including a stuffed toy 2 help him sleep that night. I will always be grateful to them.  This app allows u 2 donate to them & they need the support!",5,1,2016-01-07
2318,"Very informational and great demos and photos for reference. It's a great approach have in an emergency and gives people the help they need to potentially save a life in some circumstances. I'm glad u downloaded this because I took the quizzes after sometime of taking a first aid class and this app really refreshed my memory on what do to, plus have me more insight on other ways to help in a sticky situation.",5,1,2012-07-10
2319,"Love the app. I have a 4, 7, and 13 year old and we live on a farm and accidents have happened and the app's treatments work perfect and the advice on it too. But, before I updated the app on January 29, 2016 there was an agriculture section and now that I have updated it on January 30, 2016 the agriculture section is gone. If you could, please fix this that would be good, Thankyou.",5,1,2016-01-30
2320,"Best app I have. Very informative, thorough. and useful. I especially found the emergency feature strait forward. It is set up to guides a person through emergency care by asking questions specific to that situation and guiding them through the procedures step by step and providing illustrations, some of which are animated.  So even if you panic you won't skip an important step. Amazing!!!",5,1,2012-06-29
2321,"Great App. So glad my husband found. We purchased a emergency kit a while ago from the Red Cross and I would advise everyone to get one , it is very handy to have everything in one spot.
I own a daycare and haven't had to use the app for any injuries , but its a comfort to have the great info with you all the time. Thanks for creating it. Looking forward to the tornado app to be implemented.",5,1,2012-11-09
2322,"This is a great looking app with all the info you need for medical issues. I specially appreciate the emergency button (I haven't use it -thank god- but it's pretty nice they though of a way to get the info fater when in an emergency. That was my first concerne ""I'm not going to go through all the categories when in an emergency"", until I saw the that big button in the middle :P",5,1,2012-07-01
2323,"I have to agree with several reviews- most of the time it does say to call 911, but what if there is no cell service? However, it is very helpful for minor accidents. It is easy to quickly find resources to help the hurt person, because it lists household items in which you can use in case of lack of actual medical supplies. It even tests you to make sure you know what to do immediately.",4,1,2016-03-12
2324,"The rural safety quiz is still there but not the initial information where you can see it. It is up at the top with the slideshow with information about flu pandemics, but it's better to have it with the rest of the information, or in both places. 
The poison information needs more fleshing out. And there's some useful spelling and grammar checks to be done. But overall great.",4,1,2016-05-28
2325,"I really love this app. Whether you find yourself in an emergency situation, or just want to know how to treat a bug bite, this app can be very helpful. It gives basic first aid knowledge that everyone should know. I really like the quiz feature because it allows me to see how well I know my stuff! This app is responsible for my signing up for my first blood donation appointment. Great app!",5,1,2014-06-12
2326,"I thought I knew how to handle things in certain situations, but I was wrong. This app showed me the right way to approach these very real, everyday situations.  There is even a quizzes to test your knowledge of what you've read and learned.  Does anyone need help? I know what to do now :). Check this app out for yourself, you'll be glad you did.",5,1,2014-01-17
2327,"This should be a mandatory app for anyone adventuresome.  Nice features are:  Nicely grouped first aid categories, a prepare section for all types of emergencies, and hospitals near you.  What would be even nicer would be hospital groupings.  I saw long term elderly care and behavioral hospitals listed alongside ER type hospitals and no private urgent care facilities were on the list.  I also liked the link to the Red Cross ""store"" where you could buy reasonably priced aid kits.",4,1,2015-04-26
2328,"As a Red Cross Instructor I had to shudder at the broken test site in this app. Just like their Instructor site, it doesn't work and when you ask them to fix it, they are all happy and helpful, but it doesn't get done. But alas that is another story. I like the app, they need to fix the bugs in the tests and update the hospital info area. Otherwise, it has good information, but please get certified in CPR and First Aide  by a qualified instructor before attempting anything in this app.",3,1,2014-12-21
2329,"This is a great app to have. It has a lot of great basic information and various topics. It obviously can't have ALL the information on these topics or else it wouldn't be handy. Might as well carry around a medical encyclopedia if that's what you're expecting. 

I consider this a must download and I've recommended it to all my friends and family.",5,1,2014-08-14
2330,"The training includes provides a terrific BASIC summary of what you should do for a variety of common medical emergencies and situations. Very well done.
The app could go even further by letting you enter SOAP notes about a patient's condition directly into the app, such as tracking heart rate, photos of wounds, etc. But it does a great job for what it is. 
EVERYONE should have this app.",5,1,2012-10-31
2331,This is a great app and a must have. If your like me and always have to have your phone around you then u got to have this app. You never know what can happen these day and being able to hit the app look up what to do and be able to help someone is a must. You never know this app may save you or someone you love.,5,1,2013-05-28
2332,I love the support the Red Cross gives to people in need. From blood donation to natural disasters they are always there. When I found the app I was interested and I found all the information to be really helpful and it's a nice reassurance to have in an emergency. It's cool because you can take a quiz to see if you learned the material and then you earn a badge.,5,1,2013-05-24
2333,"As someone who worked for and volunteered for the American Red Cross for many years, was delighted to see this app arrive in the App Store. Well-done content, info, videos, and quizzes on many First Aid topics -- valuable for anyone's mobile devices. Thanks for making it free, ARC ... But do support your local ARC and/or via options in this app.",5,1,2012-07-03
2334,"This app has very good basic information to help people who may encounter a medical emergency.  There are short videos, answers to FAQ's, and simple to follow instructions.  I highly recommend going through the various topics as you can, instead of waiting until you have to use it.  Kudos to the ARC for designing such a user-friendly app!",5,1,2014-04-21
2335,"I was just in an unfortunate situation yesterday. I didn't think of this app at the time and luckily there were others around who knew what to do. But I am reviewing the life saving advice in the app so I am better prepared next time. Thank you for this app - you are saving lives.

PS. This app is great, however is has crashed on me with my iPhone 5.",5,1,2013-06-22
2336,"Make sure members of your family know which device you have this app loaded and what the button to open it looks like.  The instructions may help someone to save a life.  If you can pass the tests you will be one big step ahead of a dangerous situation.  Plus, it will be good to be and feel like a hero!",5,1,2016-12-04
2337,"The designers of this app took excellent attention to detail to deliver critical information in an elegant way. From the simple splash screen to make the app feel like it's loading fast to the excellent red Tooltip and oscillating glowing effect surrounding the Emergency button.

2338,"I've had this app for many months, and thankfully, haven't needed it.  However,I needed it today while on a road trip. 

My friend was facing an allergic reaction to shrimp. While it wasn't impacting her ability to breathe, she had severe vomiting and stomach pain. I came to the app for advice. Unfortunately, nothing loaded. I searched ""allergy"" and ""allergic reaction"" and nothing ever populated in the description.  Nothing. Ever. 

Luckily, we waited it out and my friend was fine, but I expected at least SOME information from a reputable organization / app.  I was completely disappointed.",1,-1,2013-07-28
2339,"As a CPR Instructor, I've downloaded dozens of first aid apps to see which is the best out there. This app, by far, beats the others. It has all the features you need - critical, clear, accurate, and thorough information. Quick download, no need for internet connection. Synced with 911. Quizzes and other interactive tools to keep you sharp. Great job, Red Cross!",5,1,2012-06-14
2340,People said the when you tap on the test part it will stop working and shut you off well that did not happen i was looking for an app like this than my friend recommend this app it works great all of the information is the same I learned in medical school thumbs up to this app!,5,1,2015-06-08
2341,"I personally love how they put it in the format that they did. Somebody was unconscious but breathing and I helped them because at first I didn't know what to do then I went into then app and there it was i done what I was supposed to do and I called 911 and everything was ok. My point is, I saved a life because of this app...❤️😷",5,1,2014-05-29
2342,"This is a great app for quick advice in case of medical issues. You can test yourself after reading the info to make sure you understand what you read. It's quick reading even if you're in the middle of a problem. If you can remember to pull out your cell, you'll get great advice.",5,1,2012-07-05
2343,"It's got some good stuff, but it leaves out a lot that could be included. The instructions seemed dumbed down. For example, EMS personnel are trained to elevate the legs of a person showing signs of shock to improve circulation to the heart. Here, we are instructed not to because of potential spinal injury. WELL, JUST TELL US NOT TO IF THERE IS A SUSPECTED SPINAL INJRY. Seems to me they are more scared of lawsuit than patient care.,",4,0,2014-02-18
2344,"You took First Aid and CPR instruction, but now you need a refresher for a particular immediate emergency.  This is what you need!  It doesn't replace training, but enhances skills previously learned along with preparedness information.  As an employee of Red Cross, I am thrilled to be able to share something that could help save lives!  Awesome app!",5,1,2012-06-14
2345,"This app is wonderful. I am already a lifeguard and up to date with my certification but for those who are not as educated, this is a great app to save a life one day. I would recommend everyone to have this app. It's great practice for someone to understand basics of helping someone in an emergency.",5,1,2015-06-12
2346,"Easy to follow instructions and information on basic first aid. It even includes pictures, videos, and quizzes to confirm that you've understood what you learned. Great option included that allows you to call 911 directly from the app. Highly recommended.",5,1,2014-11-10
2347,Everything that I learned from the corse is right there!! Now when i babysit I don't have to bring my book. There are tests on here to make sure u know what to do in case of emergencys. During emergencys u hit the button that describes the medical problem and then goes trough the process of what to do until EMS gets there.,5,-1,2012-07-03
2348,This app is amazing!!!! It is full of descriptions and detailed instructions on everyday crises that everyone will have to deal with at one point in their lives. Everybody should have this app because you never know when you may need it. This app could save a life. And I'm sure it already has.,5,1,2012-07-07
2349,"This app is easy to understand and use and very accurate compared to some classes I have taken regarding emergencies. I strongly recommend this for baby sitters, or parents to refer to in an emergency after training especially and everyone else as well! Great for on the go wherever you are too!",5,1,2012-07-07
2350,This app is highly informative in every field of accidents that might happen.:) I am very happy that I got this app. This thing can be useful to know in a emergency situation but also to remember in the future !!:) this is a really good app I've been looking for a app like this now I finally found it !:) Thank you red cross :) <3,5,1,2012-06-29
2351,"I love this app but the thing that makes it not get 5 stars is that even though I have Wifi and I can call and text, I can't use the 911 button because I'm on my iPad mini. I can't call 911 on the regular phone app either. They need to make it able to call in case of an emergency.",5,-1,2014-04-04
2352,"Has good information on first aid, burns, chocking and preparedness.
But the best part are the quizzes to test what you learned or what you think you know.
There is a button in case you are in emergency and to get you the right info fast!
I gave 4 🌟 only because it's basic first aid and if you've taken emergency training, it's not very challenging.",4,-1,2012-07-16
2353,"Red Cross had done it again!  This app is another great tool to have...i have downloaded all of their apps and this is right up there with first aid and hurricane.  The information is easy to digest and although i hope never to need it,  i am glad i have it.  Another job well done!",5,1,2012-09-28
2354,"Interesting with hurricane reports, for those parts of the country other than the west coast. After a bad storm, it's highly likely you won't see first responders right away. Best to arm yourself with a bit of knowledge. Easy to follow. Useful, but don't expect it to take the place of a First Aid manual.",5,1,2012-09-04
2355,"Seems like a great app so far, however each time I attempt to email it to my coworkers, it freezes (iPhone 4). I then have to delete the app and re-download it for access. So, I will just recommend it and hope it doesn't freeze in an emergency! Otherwise, it looks like this app will be very helpful.",4,1,2013-07-03
2356,"I love this app! I only got it because I stay home alone with my little brother a lot and wanted to be prepared incase something happened to him. It is great for children, but probably best for 8 and up. There are pictures in the app that may scare them.",5,1,2014-03-23
2357,This app is very easy to maneuver through to find the emergency going on around you. It also has great emergency lists for things you might not have thought of. I had forgotten to put a travel water bowl for my dog in our emergency kit. Now that's checked off too.,5,-1,2012-06-30
2358,I was a volunteer EMT for a number of years through college and up. This is a great reference to utilize in the first steps of an emergency. Substitute your daily commuter book with this as reading some of the life saving strategies and precaution tips can very well help improve your chances of survival during a real occurrence.,5,1,2013-03-11
2359,"I knew most of this information before I saw the app, so I know it's accurate and useful, went straight to the test and gave what I knew to be the right answers and got all of them right. My only complaint is some of the phrasing but overall accurate and great knowledge",5,1,2012-07-04
2360,"As a former, certified EMT, I'm well aware that someone who's able to grasp even the basics of emergency care can potentially save life and limb. I feel that this app can arm you with these basic skills; if necessary, until EMS has arrived. Read it, study it and test yourself with it. Humanity will thank you.",5,1,2016-02-24
2361,"Everything's 100% perfect BESIDES the tests, I'd highly recommend a difficulty option to them because at the moment they're extremely easy. Other then that amazing job! I hope I can continue to see other improvements.",5,1,2014-03-01
2362,"This app is so helpful. I can't wait till the  other apps cone out. I use and study with it everyday! If possible, i would give it 10 stars. 100% good. Although i am cpr certtified, and i teach first aid, it is still a very good refresher. And, incase you forget a step in something, it shows all steps.",5,1,2012-07-08
2363,"The app is great, but there needs to be considerably more information for different types of incidents. Fainting, head trauma isn't thorough enough on someone who may be confused, and so on. I understand there are limitations, and that a course is much better than an App. But having extra is always great. The Emphasis on 911 is great.",4,1,2014-01-25
2364,"As someone certified in first aid and CPR, this app is my virtual pocket book to stay refreshed on everything. On top of that, i believe everyone needs this app, in case any emergency were to happen. I particularly like the quizzes, of which you don't pass unless you get 100% right. Great app!",5,1,2016-11-26
2365,"I rarely write reviews but this app is so helpful and a great way to stay sharp on helping others in need should an occasion rise. So informative and the mini self tests are great. This app is simple and covers a wide range of cpr, first aid and medical health issues. I feel everyone should have this app.",5,1,2015-09-28
2366,I would like to think its a useful application on a smartphone. It gives you pointers on some useful emergencies and the app gives access to the web site to contact to get trained in CPR and other helpful emergency training. Keep up the good work and keep updating with more useful knowledge.,5,1,2012-06-19
2367,Great resource to use to stay on top of information and to be able to access it handily if needed in an emergency. Nearest hospital information based upon your current location can save a lot of stress and get patient help faster.,5,1,2015-02-17
2368,"This is an overall great application! Thank you American Red Cross :•) The app has just about every scenario and remedy in a smooth interface list. There is a handy dandy checklist, which is very helpful. This is a MUST HAVE app!! Gives great advice for before, during and after disasters and complications.",5,1,2014-07-21
2369,"Great first aid application. However, it would be great if you could search for a term (i.e. Blister or altitude sickness) and get a description of what to do next. It seems to be missing some very basic first aid descriptions.... Muscle cramps, blisters, altitude sickness, etc. 

The application is named ""First Aid"". So a bit more first aid instruction should be included.",4,1,2017-01-19
2370,"The test yourself in choking part of the app says its wrong to give a three yr old the same choking procedures as an adult, when that is the correct answer. I tried the other wrong answers though, and those were not correct either.  Other than that, awesome app",4,-1,2013-03-24
2371,"There are so many useful parts to this app. From first aid to cpr, tests, a direct call 911 button, a store where you can purchase supplies, and much more. Easy to use and understand. Highly recommend for everyone to have on their smartphone.",5,1,2015-06-24

2373,"I've been a lifeguard now for 6 years and an ARC trainer now for 3. It is a good app for a refresher and additional information but by NO MEANS a substitute for real training. For all those bashing the common sense steps, it is those simple step people forget when in an emergency situation. Overall very well created app.",4,-1,2012-07-07
2374,I have ran with ambulance services for many years and know what to do in an emergency . I wanted to check out this app for family and friends . If you are someone that does not do these things on a regular bases GET THIS APP.. You could save someone's life with it .,5,1,2012-11-01
2375,This is a handy little app to have on hand.  We always have our phones with us and we never know when an emergency is going to happen.  Good interface and a lot of information at hand when needed.,5,1,2012-09-30
2376,"This app has come in hand especially when you're on the go, you can just pull a whole course out off your pocket...one thing I think can be improved is the tests... They don't do enough questions. They need to do more and not the same questions every time. But other that that, its a great app:)",4,1,2012-07-01
2377,"Very informative and I love how you can ""test yourself"" after reading the article, but the app keeps closing and crashing after I take the test. As I go to answer the last question of any of the tests, the app completely closes. Still a great app though!",4,1,2015-07-05
2378,"I really found this app useful and for all those people with the iPhone 5, who cares how big the screen is! I'm in middle school and  this app makes me feel like if theres an emergency in my classroom or at home I might save someones life. Thank you for making this app! :)",5,1,2013-05-29
2379,The Red Cross first aid learning app is a great tool to learn and be able to apply that learning in helping others in medical need and also the knowledge is fundamental to an individual to identify symptoms in themselves or others and can help to get professional medical help when needed great app!,5,1,2013-01-20
2380,"I love the simplicity all in small in so much info. My only complaint with Apple is that is that is marked as a Game Center. I don't know if this is shortly or long term, this needs to be as all over. Safety, and help in need. 5 stars are for sure group- keep it good, remember knowledge is the key.",5,1,2012-06-17
2381,for a free app I think this is great and speaking personally it is one if the few apps that is actually useful. it is basic information but some of the things I did not know even though it is basic. it would be nice if there was a video about how to help someone that is choking. I gave it 3 stars because I think it can be improved,3,1,2012-08-30
2382,"This is a great app with a vast amount of knowledge. However, the testing portion is completely broken, does not work at all. You can have all of the correct answers and it will say you only have one or two correct. Coming from the Red Cross you would think this app would work flawlessly. Once the testing is fixed I will be glad to update my rating.",2,1,2015-01-02
2383,"Great Information at your hands, I strongly recommend EVERYONE willing and able to download this and read it.

2384,"I took a few mins to go through the app and get familiar with it. Great app! It says it's not the same as taking the course, and I must agree. I am disabled and can't take the course, but it is a great refresher to what I learned years ago. Kudos to the personnel who contributed!",5,1,2012-08-28
2385,Everyone should go through the trainings and watch the videos. Well set-up and easy to use; much more convenient than any other way to get this information. Encourages me to make an emergency kit and update my CPR certification too.,5,1,2012-07-14
2386,"Thank you for creating something very useful to share with family and friends. 

I hope other topics will be added. One of the most often questions I get is ""I stepped on a nail what should I do?"". A module for puncture wounds would be helpful.",5,1,2012-06-15
2387,"This is a great and handy app. I've literally helped 4 people already with a broken bone, choking, burns, and bleeding. But I think it should have more quizzes like make new quizzes every 1-2 weeks then we can learn more but otherwise it's a great, handy, and helpful app",5,1,2016-08-05
2388,"Love this app.  I always want to be prepared in the event of an emergency, especially because I am responsible for the safety of 500+ kids.  This is a simple, easy way to stay prepared and review vital information that can get fuzzy over time despite attending a training.",5,1,2014-09-27

2391,This is probably one of the best ways to learn emergency needs. Easy to use and it would be a great way to test some kids! I love this app and DEFINITELY recommend getting it! You will not regret it! I have to learn this stuff for girls camp! This Makes it so much easier!! ,5,1,2012-10-29

• Always make sure someone knows where you are and when you should return.
• Wear a GPS locator!
• Don't try to outrun an avalanche downhill if you can get out of the way by cutting diagonally.
• Don't wear headphones in an area where avalanches are likely. Your only warning will be audible if you are skiing/snowboarding downhill.",4,-1,2016-04-28

Pitiful.

[UPDATE]

Okay I just read through 500+ reviews of clueless people who apparently do not know EXTREMELY BASIC FIRST AID, or what numbers to press to call Emergency Services.

3722,"Red Cross official app, there is an ""emergency"" section, which is classified according to different situations, telling everyone what to do in various emergencies, the key is to have a stored local video introduction! Locally stored videos! No longer have to worry about the NB network environment in China. ",5,-1,2012-08-07
3723,"Very good FREE app for pocket reference. It has tests, which according to recent research (this writing as of 02/2015), is better for memory retention than just re-reading. Has various subjects for the non-first-aid person . Has an Emergency section that you can use in a hurry with a Call 911 button.

Even has an achievement system, if you're into that.

Only issue I've experienced is cross-referencing. E.g.: Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke (You have to go into one to see the other).

If you're interested in basic first-aid, this is a good app to read/study through.",4,1,2015-02-09

3732,"This is a must have for everyone. You never know when you will need to know how to do CPR, or help someone to breath. 
Do you know how to treat a burn or to stop bleeding?
How about what to do for a snake or sider bite?
Do you know how to get in touch with poison control?

3734,"Great info and design. Love the iOS 7 look and feel of the app.

Needs search function.",5,1,2014-11-18
3735,"1. This is not a completely reliable database for the official medical techniques and knowledge it advertises. Too afraid of imperfect and causing someone to get hurt over an ignorant rescue when that is going to cause a worse problem. They would rather you call 9-1-1 and wait for the police then tell you what you REALLY should do to a bleeding wound, snake bite, heart attack, etc... I should hope one wouldnt solely rely on this app for a camping trip or if they are hours away from a quality hostpittle. Don't download this without looking at it first. The info on treating a heart attack literally say this: 1. See if they have unexplained pain (and do not mention the left arm sign) 2. Call 911 3 give them aspirin 4. Reassure them. Really? 

2 unclean design, lack of content and videos. There is no section that portrays how to deal with no-serious injures, such as swelling or icing after a run. Few videos and photos are all blown up with low resolution. 

3.It should be fully functional without internet. I know this is an iphone app, but don't shut it off if I'm using an ipad and I'm away from wifi. 

All in all Im disappointed because i see HUGE value in it. If it was sleek enough to droll over, wise enough to tech you and not be worried that someone will use it ineffectively(some knowledge is better than none, add to the disclaimer), accessible, updating frenquetly, FULL OF DETAIL, and put forth the actual bank of knowledge that educators have stored, it would be well on its way yo educating children and adults alike, and maximizing its usefulness. Teenagers in particular think first aid is a very vool subject when presented correctly, with all the facts. Its like a martial arts discipline.This app could be legendary, so throw some funding in or get rid of it, the camper manual is out-doing it so far except the awesome tests. Don't ice it with any childish features. Make it excessively informative and professional sounding, as though you were reading a wikipedia page decorated with red and silver. (Wolfram aha connectivity)  This could be an outlet for people to relish in medical knowledge as a hobby, and it couldn't hurt to have more life guards in everyday life!",2,1,2014-07-23

3743,"Good points:    
Having taken ARC first aid & CPR classes in the past, this app is a good refresher and very useful for those who haven't taken such classes and are trying to get ahead of the curve in an emergency.   

Like to see added:
In going through the app to see what first aid topics it covered, I noticed that it did not have anything for any of the heat-related emergency situations: heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat rash.  These are covered in the American Red Cross ""Heat Wave Safety Checklist"" (at RedCross.org > Preparing > Preparedness Fast Facts) so it is surprising it's not covered in the app.  Of course, it could be that the only reason I noticed its absence is because it was almost 100F today, one of many very hot days we've been having lately.  Hope to see heat-related illness added in an upcoming update.",4,1,2012-06-17
